<h1>Point-Counterpoint: Kill the Homeless, or Just Treat Them Like Animals?</h1>

<section class="single">
<p>The most pressing question for residents of our fair city is <em>how do
we get rid of the sorts of people we don&rsquo;t like?</em> Finding an answer to
this question is urgent due to the very large number of people we find
objectionable:
<a href="http://www.independent.com/news/2013/may/16/heated-debate-over-gang-injunction/" title="SB Independent: Heated Debate Over Gang Injunction">young men of color</a>,
<a href="http://thebottomline.as.ucsb.edu/2013/05/violent-altercation-breaks-out-in-iv-provoked-by-homophobic-remarks" title="Violent Altercation Breaks Out in IV, Provoked By Homophobic
Remarks">gender, sexual, and romantic minorities (GSRMs)</a>, and <em>especially</em> the homeless.</p>

<p>As much as we dislike people who look and love other than we do, our
most righteous fury is reserved for those who&mdash;outrageously&mdash;find
themselves living on the street.  We therefore owe the <em>Santa Barbara
View</em> our gratitude for hosting a debate on what to do with these
filthy individuals who remind us, unfairly and distressingly, of the
grave inequality in our society.  Those who have recently taken to
existing on State Street are particularly galling, given that the
<em>point</em> of going to State Street is to forget about all that.</p>

<p>So something has to be done.  But what?</p>

<p>Doctor Loretta Redd, PhD (she has a PhD, everyone), asks us to see the
homeless population as a band of stray animals.  One should not
necessarily feed the strays, but rather support the shelters that are
equipped to care for them.  The analogy is apt:
<a href="http://www.santabarbaraview.com/more-givingless-helping-santa-barbara6535387/" title="More Giving=Less Helping">&ldquo;It is time to face the harm we are doing by giving money to those unable to use it wisely,&rdquo;</a>, writes Redd (who has a PhD), making the
obvious but often-overlooked point that a house or apartment is a
precondition of rationality.  She suggests that instead of feeding
these anthropomorphized seagulls, we</p>

<blockquote>
<p>follow the Atlanta model, and <strong>install &ldquo;giving meters&rdquo;</strong> on
sidewalks, or on private property if owners are willing, where the
money could be collected and transferred to programs of transitional
housing or intensive professional service to assist those addicted
to substances.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An interesting proposal, but not one that is to the liking of
Dr. Redd&rsquo;s sparring partner in this online debate.  Sharon Byrne (who
does <em>not</em>, apparently, have a PhD), argues that
<a href="http://www.santabarbaraview.com/the-business-of-homelessness-in-santa-barbara/" title="The Business of Homelessness in Santa Barbara, California">shelters like Casa Esperanza have existed for a number of years and continue to pay their employees</a>, proof of
their profound corruption.  Moreover,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For all the money that has been spent, is still being spent, and
what it&rsquo;s being spent on &hellip;</p>

<p>How well is the city really tackling this issue?</p>

<p>Could it be done better?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These are, of course, rhetorical questions, since we know that
<a href="http://www.santabarbaraview.com/whose-city-is-it-anyway2542252/" title="Whose City Is It, Anyway?">truly helping other people is tree-hugger bullshit</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[Some suggest that we] <strong>stop Wall St Greed, and end the disparity
between rich and poor to solve homelessness.</strong> Sure, we&rsquo;ll get right
on that. No one&rsquo;s solved it in decades, but let Santa Barbara lead
the charge!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And in any case, Sharon Byrne has done extensive research and
discovered that &ldquo;the bench occupiers [on State Street] aren&rsquo;t
homeless.&rdquo; (She has not released the data supporting this claim,
presumably because she plans on publishing her findings and is afraid
of academic plagiarism.  Understandable.)</p>

<p>What, then, is Byrne&rsquo;s suggestion?  How are we do deal with this
plague of undesirables?  She, unfortunately, has no answers, but
recognizes that this question is of
<a href="http://www.santabarbaraview.com/whose-city-is-it-anyway2542252/" title="Whose City Is It, Anyway?">existential import</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Whose city is it, anyway???</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If homeless youths are allowed to remain in Santa Barbara, Sharon
Byrne is gone.  Much as in the pitiful case of
<a href="http://www.independent.com/news/2013/jun/14/sidewalk-weapons/" title="Terrorists on Wheels">a woman driven out of town by terrorists</a>, it is perfectly clear who we would rather
have living in our city.</p>
