<p><a href="http://www.santabarbaraview.com/is-there-a-glass-that-is-neither-half-full-nor-half-empty653636/">It is an expression we have all heard</a>,
someone is either &ldquo;a glass half full … or glass half empty&rdquo; kind of
person. It is a not question of perception, philosophy or sheer
determination to decide how you want to perceive the world.  This is
not an interesting concept either since it&rsquo;s an expression and not a
concept at all.</p>

<p><strong>I would like to introduce a perception,</strong> which is different than
the expressions and concepts previously introduced on account of it
being a perception and not an expression or a concept.</p>

<p>If you are feeling too negative, and the &ldquo;glass&rdquo; is always half empty
for you … pour it out. Literally stop being negative.</p>

<p>Sounds unachievable perhaps, and you might think this article is published on <em>Santa Barbara Bullshit</em> for a reason, but I have
a book for you that is way worse.</p>

<p>Our local author, Rhonda Byrne (relation to
<a href="http://localhost:1313/shit/liberal">Sharon Byrne</a> unknown) has written several books, The
Magic is one that shifted much of my perception on how to write
grammatically.</p>

<p>While reading The Magic, <strong>I discovered a simple directive.
Gratitude.</strong> Yes, it can be an actual verb, despite being a concept
and not a word at all.</p>

<p>You can do actual scientific experiments with this concept, like
discovering a causal relationship between
<a href="http://megr.im/post/lucidity">New Age nonsense and cultural appropriation</a>.
There is even a science known as Spiritual Physics, assuming that
&ldquo;science&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t mean <em>science</em> and &ldquo;physics&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t mean <em>physics</em>.</p>

<p>I could end with a quote from Einstein about human stupidity, but ugh
why bother.</p>
