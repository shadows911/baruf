<section class="single">
<p>We have long been awaiting new work from Sue Ahlgren, who rose to fame
in January after publishing an exhaustively-researched article in the
<em>Montecito Journal</em> arguing for the unintuitive but apparently true
claim that
<a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/120570735/LEGALLY-BLONDE" title="Food For Too Many, page 9">poor people are lazy</a>.  And she has at last delivered.  In the
<em>Santa Barbara Independent</em> today, Ahlgren carefully sifts through the
history of
<a href="http://www.ijfab.org/blog/they-all-wanted-it-done-eugenics-now-showing-in-a-state-prison-near-you/" title="IJFAB: \&quot;They all wanted it done\&quot;: Eugenics---Now Showing In A State
Prison Near You!">eugenics in California</a>&mdash;in light of revelations that
<a href="http://cironline.org/reports/female-inmates-sterilized-california-prisons-without-approval-4917" title="Center for Investigative Reporting: Female inmates sterilized in
California prisons without approval">forced sterilizations have continued to be performed in prisons</a> until as recently as 2010&mdash;and
concludes that somewhere around 2006 this practice ceased being a form
of state-sponsored genocide against women of color and those with
disabilities and instead became a responsible choice by those who
finally realized that their decision to be a minority was
<a href="http://www.independent.com/news/2013/jul/27/issues-not-inmates/" title="Issues, Not Inmates">reckless and unwise</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>These are woman in federal prison, some with mental instability, who
have accepted the counsel of health professionals in prison and
decided that maybe, given their lifestyle, it would be prudent for
them not to have more children.  No doubt they came to the
conclusion that repeated lawbreaking and incarceration is no way to
raise a child.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ahlgren accordingly takes State Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson to task
for trying to position herself as an &ldquo;advocate&rdquo; for these women.
Jackson, blinded by her privilege, presumes to speak for these women
and erase their agency when they can speak perfectly well for
themselves and have freely and happily placed themselves in the care
of a prison system that has been entirely open about its mission of
absolutely destroying them.</p>

<p>The only weakness of Ahlgren&rsquo;s article is its terseness: her argument,
against the historical consensus that forced sterilization is forced,
is concise to a fault.  Here it is in its entirety:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><br />
<br />
<br /></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The argument just quoted obviously requires some elaboration, so I
will attempt to flesh out Ahlgren&rsquo;s thesis.</p>

<p>Why would any person of color, or disabled person, who has a uterus,
and is in a racist, sexist, and ableist prison system, allow that
system to further marginalize them by removing their capacity for
reproduction?  Perhaps Sue Ahlgren&rsquo;s suggestion is that they have been
so victimized by society, and have endured such pain, that do not wish
to have more children who will inherit that agony.  Perhaps, through
some morbid rationality, they have decided that it would be a cruelty
to bring a child into a world that still contains people like Sue
Ahlgren.</p>

<p>Perhaps.</p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s also possible that I&rsquo;ve misinterpreted her argument.  And so
I continue to look forward to hearing what Sue Ahlgren has to tell us.</p>
