<p>I&rsquo;ve decided to enter the race for mayor as a write-in candidate.  As
our newly elected mayor, my first order of business will enure that
all official correspondence takes the form of rhetorical questions.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s brush aside my qualifications and everything else that&rsquo;s
relevant and discuss an issue the surface of which was barely
scratched&mdash;the police chief&rsquo;s idea for a door-to-door campaign to
discuss the &ldquo;homeless problem&rdquo;.  If I am so adept at this art of
misdirection already, will I not be an admirable politician?</p>

<p>Now that I&rsquo;ve hitched my announcement of candidacy to a topic that
will only interest the people who comment at the <em>Santa Barbara
View</em>&mdash;how about we dishonestly suppose that such a campaign is
motivated by some abstract principle, and then generalize that
principle in the hopes of deriving some absurd conclusion?</p>

<p>Doesn&rsquo;t it say something about my priorities that this is the most
important thing I can think to write about?</p>

<p>Most importantly, have you learned anything about me and my political
views in this letter?</p>

<p>Thank you for your time.  I hope to see you at the next City Council
meeting.</p>

<p>&mdash; Reven C. Steynalds, <em>Santa Barbara</em></p>
