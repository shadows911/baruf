<p>Santa Barbara&rsquo;s a small town, but there&rsquo;s always room for another
pundit.  Indeed, we have quite an enviable concentration of writers
willing to bullshit (in the
<a href="http://philosophynow.org/issues/53/On_Bullshit_by_Harry_Frankfurt" title="*On Bullshit* by Harry Frankfurt">technical sense</a>) in our local publications.  If
Sharon Byrne is our city&rsquo;s Thomas Friedman, putting forth an
<a href="liberal.html" title="A New Argument for Moral
Relativism">incoherent pragmatism</a> divorced from truth or morality as a solution to our
political conflicts, then Cheri Rae is our very own David Brooks and
Craig Allen is
<a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Adaringfireball.net+enderle">Rob Enderle</a>.</p>

<p>Rae and Allen both have written recent columns that are admirable in
their pursuit of
<a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/info/06words.htm">truthiness</a>.  Rae&rsquo;s
column is
<a href="http://www.santabarbaraview.com/drive-they-say653663/" title="Drive! They Say.">a lovely wistful meditation</a> on the necessity of cars.  She mocks the idea that
we should promote alternative modes of transportation with this chunk
of hard data:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When the 16th birthday dawns, it&rsquo;s finally time to earn the Golden
Ticket to Freedom and Adulthood: the Driver&rsquo;s License. Some, as my
own son did, make their appointments for the first moment of the
first day they can officially take the driving test.  Others, like
my own daughter wait a year or two, but the idea of not
driving&mdash;ever, or rarely&mdash;never enters their minds at all.</p>

<p>Truth is, driving is high up there on the list of teen essentials,
along with smartphones, texting and hanging out.  Just take a look
at the completely packed student parking lots at our local high
schools&mdash;and the fine luxury cars so many kids are driving from
home to school and all over town.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I could counter with nostalgic anecdotes of my own, telling the unique
life histories of my several friends in their 20s who have yet to get
a license, but I&rsquo;m bored and I found this by typing &ldquo;decline in teen
driving&rdquo; into Google and clicking the first result:</p>

<p><img src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/business/Drivers_Licenses_Sivak_Michigan.PNG" alt="From a report by Michael Sivak and Brandon Schoettle of the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute, cited by [The Atlantic](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/07/the-dramatic-30-year-decline-of-young-drivers-in-1-chart/260126/)" />
</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s move on to Craig Allen, who wrote
<a href="http://www.noozhawk.com/article/craig_allen_apple_computers_20131027" title="Craig Allen: Apple at Risk of Becoming an 'Also-Ran'">an equally ignorant and ahistorical thinkpiece</a> on Apple&rsquo;s
prospects.  He starts with a complaint so deep and important that it
has been uttered by every Wordpress blogger since late 2011: that &ldquo;in
the time since Jobs died, Apple has released numerous evolutionary
products&mdash;new versions of the iPhone and iPad, but has not released
any truly new, revolutionary products to rival its current lineup.&rdquo;
This insight derives its force from the scientific principle that
since the three &ldquo;revolutionary products&rdquo; usually recognized by
pundits&mdash;the iPod, iPhone and iPad&mdash;debuted in 2001, 2007, and 2010,
the next revolution should surely have occurred sometime in 2011 or
2012, even though Jobs has only recently ceased to be the subject of
<a href="http://maypalo.com/2011/10/09/top-5-best-steve-jobs-in-heaven-comics/">shitty cartoons set in Heaven</a>.</p>

<p>Allen can be forgiven for overlooking
<a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/1151235/apple_rolls.html" title="This is how Apple rolls">the arcane scholastic doctrine of &ldquo;incrementalism&rdquo;</a> that some Medieval theorists believed
better explains Apple&rsquo;s history.  It is a much more complicated thesis
than the one Allen and most of his contemporaries rely on, which is
the single word &ldquo;INNOVATION&rdquo; written in 72pt Impact font.</p>

<p>Allen is correct, however, to bemoan the apparently
increasingly-desperate efforts to fool investors into valuing Apple
highly.
<a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/10/28/5039154/apple-q4-2013-earnings">Pitiful revenues last quarter</a>
and increasingly dismal
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/30/business/media/apple-passes-coca-cola-as-most-valuable-brand.html?_r=0">brand recognition</a>
support his assertion that &ldquo;Apple&rsquo;s management team must produce real
revenue growth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He is also correct to compare Apple to another dedicated cellphone
manufacturer that failed when its only product was made obsolete:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As great as Apple has been, its trajectory is similar to many other
companies that were once high-fliers and eventually
tanked. BlackBerry is probably the best example. Not too long ago,
Blackberry had a cult-like following, so much so that people
referred to the device as a &ldquo;crackberry.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The analogy here is very good; neither Apple nor RIM are willing to
<a href="http://daringfireball.net/2008/05/blackberry_vs_iphone">cannibalize their own marketshare by coming out with better stuff</a>
and then diligently improving it.  Allen&rsquo;s closing statement is
therefore deeply troubling:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The market is sending a clear signal that Apple is in its twilight
as a major market leader.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But not for the reason he thinks.</p>
