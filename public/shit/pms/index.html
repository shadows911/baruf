<h1>Creating a Beast: Women’s Health and Social Noise</h1>

<p>The idea of PMS as a great hormonal tide that washes away women&rsquo;s
rationality does not, of course, correspond to reality.  Many were
probably nonetheless shocked last year when University of Toronto
researchers published a literature review suggesting that
<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2012/10/pms-and-the-wandering-womb/263398/" title="James Hamblin: PMS and the Wandering Womb">many of the phenomena attributed to PMS may have their source elsewhere</a>.  (Among those
unsurprised by their findings was surely Emile Nelson, who has long
insisted that
<a href="http://baruffio.com/dn/hump.html" title="How To Have Sex While Hating Yourself And Others">women never had any rationality to begin with</a>.)  Dr. Sarah
Romans even suggested that</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the whole PMS notion serves to keep women non-irritable, sweet, and
compliant the rest of the time.  There is a range of
paradoxes&mdash;world-turned-upside-down events&mdash;like festivals, Mardi
Gras, where people are socially prescribed to behave out of role.
In Europe in medieval times there&rsquo;d be one day a year where the lord
would serve his own servants and workers, and then the rest of the
time it&rsquo;s the other way, servant obeying the master.  And these
kinds of rituals serve to embed the normal behavior.  I think PMS is
a bit like that.  &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll let you be cranky and bad-tempered now, but
just for one or two days. The rest of the time you&rsquo;ve got to be like
a true woman.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s been almost a year since Romans et
al. <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550857912001349" title="ScienceDirect: Mood and the Menstrual Cycle: A Review of Prospective
Data Studies">published their results</a> in <em>Gender Medicine</em>.  Did this finally change our
narratives about women&rsquo;s emotionality?  Starshine Roshell took to the
<em>Independent</em> today to issue a
<a href="http://www.independent.com/news/2013/aug/14/pms-safety-guide-men/" title="PMS: A Safety Guide for Men">pessimistic progress report</a>.</p>

<p>Roshell&rsquo;s column contains two distinct threads.  One is a
straightforward exposition of what should, by now, be obvious:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;d love to be able to dismiss our emotional extremes as
the hormone-fueled flare-ups of an estrogen-addled lunatic rather
than have to consider whether you&rsquo;ve actually done something wrong
(HOW HARD IS IT TO PICK A DIFFERENT FORK?). But it&rsquo;s not like we&rsquo;re
schizophrenic, possessed by the devil, or on a bender; we&rsquo;re still
us, reacting to genuine feelings about real things.</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s worth reminding you that men behave unpredictably and
unpleasantly from time to time: The teenaged boy who roars from
sulking to rage in 60 seconds flat, the grown man who grows
despondent when we&rsquo;re out of coffee or snippy when he misses his
morning workout &hellip; Those chemical surges&rsquo;ll mess with your mind!</p>

<p>But if empathy alone won&rsquo;t keep you from playing the condescending
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got PMS&rdquo; card, then do it for your own safety. Because when
you dismiss our concerns&mdash;deranged as they may seem&mdash;as the bogus
byproducts of a biological function, it belittles our distress and
defines us as poorly engineered, malfunctioning freaks.</p>

<p>Once we&rsquo;ve been labeled with the scarlet P, we can no longer be
heard; even legitimate worries and reasonable frustrations are
ignored as involuntary theatrics.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But woven between these paragraphs is another thread that disrupts and
confuses the points being made.  It is the trope of PMS-induced
hysteria, which Roshell introduces to show that the old story is still
the one being told:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We have arrived, yet again, at that odious interlude of each lunar
cycle when there is a small chance that I will throw something heavy
at your head.  There&rsquo;s also a chance that during the next three days
I will snatch something out of your hands because you are doing it
wrong, shriek &ldquo;WHO ATE THE LAST BROWNIE?&rdquo; at a pterodactyl pitch,
and begin weeping inconsolably because you set the table and gave me
that fork I don&rsquo;t like&mdash;that one freaking fork that is so easy to
avoid in the utensils drawer and that you know very well I dislike,
but you just had to put it at my place, didn&rsquo;t you? You never have
respected me, not for one minute of our lives, and this is how you
choose to show me.</p>

<p>Welcome to hell, fellas.</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>Your wife/mother/girlfriend/sister is a porcupine who has swallowed
a hand grenade and doesn&rsquo;t want to die alone. But with a steady
supply of wine and simple carbohydrates, she might&mdash;might&mdash;be able
to keep The Beast shackled in the basement of her soul.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Roshell&rsquo;s intention is clearly to illustrate how even the most
sensible conversation about menstruation takes place against the
backdrop the bad old narrative.  Not only is this sort of conversation
constantly at risk of being actively derailed by the invocation of
that backdrop, but decades of sexism and misinformation have lead
listeners to immediately associate such conversations with problematic
myths.  The second thread of Roshell&rsquo;s column can therefore be thought
of as the social noise in the background of any discussion of women&rsquo;s
emotions, perpetually distracting us from what really matters.</p>

<p>Unfortunately this strategy is actually too effective because all
we&rsquo;re going to get out of this column is that women</p>

<blockquote>
<p>have no option but to cash in that free pass, stop trying to tame
our tempers, and erupt in a delirious streak of long-overdue,
blame-my-uterus, full-volume flipping freak-outs.</p>

<p>Gentlemen &hellip; meet The Beast.</p>
