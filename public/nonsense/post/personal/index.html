<h1>Mark Strong Didn&#39;t Give a Shit Before It Was Cool To Not Give a Shit</h1>

<p>Mark Strong is just about the luckiest person in the world.  Not only
is he white, male and (presumably) straight and cis, he also has a
column in the finest student newspaper at UCSB that isn&rsquo;t <em>The Bottom
Line</em> or <em>The Daily Nonsense</em>.  And if that weren&rsquo;t enough, <a href="http://dailynexus.com/2013-05-23/when-becoming-the-issue-becomes-the-issue/" title="When Becoming the Issue Becomes the Issue">ideas for
his columns simply fall into his lap wherever he goes!</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>I was digging into a new novel on the patio outside Nicoletti&rsquo;s a
few weeks back when a single word in a nearby conversation caught my
attention: divestment.</p>

<p>The pair&mdash;a guy and girl, both college-aged and bespectacled,
sipping coffee and picking at muffins&mdash;was sitting directly behind
me.  Not one to eavesdrop, I tried to find my place on the page in
front of me, but before I could, I heard the word again. Divestment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Muffins, coffee, and spectacles?  Hipsters, surely!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe they took it off the table again,&rdquo; the girl was
saying.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; the guy said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m personally offended. It just goes to
show how the ignorance in the &hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Words kept coming out of his mouth after that, but I found myself
suddenly engrossed and mulling over that two-word phrase. Personally
offended? Offended &hellip; personally? What the fuck does that even mean?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lest you thought that Mark Strong&rsquo;s success in life is only the result
of the incredible privilege he was born with, here he demonstrates
that hard work has also played a part.  Ben Moss needs at least
<a href="sexy.html" title="Stop Making Sense \(feat. Ben
Moss\)">450 words of clickbait</a> to inspire his articles, but Mark Strong can get by with just
two
<a href="http://infotrope.net/2009/08/05/action-and-reaction-on-avoiding-offense/" title="Action and reaction: on avoiding \&quot;offense\&quot;">poorly-chosen</a> words from a hipster.
&ldquo;Personally offended?  Offended &hellip; personally?&rdquo;  He plays around with
them, rolling them over his tongue, and through some alchemical
process, a column emerges.  Compare his thought process to Tom
Friedman&rsquo;s, and it becomes clear that
<a href="http://buffalobeast.com/73/feature4.htm" title="The Word is Hack: The Impossible Physics of Thomas Friedman\'s
Brain">they are related by something more than blood</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As I left the Infosys campus that evening along the road back to
Bangalore, I kept chewing on that phrase: &ldquo;The playing field is
being leveled.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What Nandan is saying, I thought, is that the playing field is being
flattened &hellip; Flattened? Flattened? My God, he&rsquo;s telling me the
world is flat!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(What the <em>fuck</em> does that even mean?)</p>

<p>After wondering for some time what it could possibly mean to be
personally offended (he having been lucky enough to avoid that
feeling), Mark Strong asks the question that has largely defined his
life:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When did we start taking things so goddamn personally?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mark Strong yearns for the days when lucky men like him could
<em>rationally</em> debate the issues of the day without having to suffer the
emotional outbursts of those personally affected.  These hysterical
children should be ignored, for &ldquo;in personalizing the issue, [they]
eradicate [their] ability to think of it objectively.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Happily for Mark Strong, he doesn&rsquo;t really care very much about
Palestine, abortion, and other vitally important issues (in this way,
he&rsquo;s something of a hipster himself).  They&rsquo;re interesting things to
play Devil&rsquo;s advocate with, but ultimately (luckily!) they don&rsquo;t
affect Mark Strong&rsquo;s life, so why would anyone get worked up about
them?  Just <em>let it go</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I finished chapter seven and stowed Stephen King&rsquo;s <em>Misery</em> in the
front pocket of my backpack, leaving the pair to bicker in peace on
the patio in the bright May sunshine.</p>
