<h1>Batman is Best at Everything, Including Fighting the Matriarchy</h1>

<p>It has been more than four decades since the last Men&rsquo;s Rights
Activists were routed by Misandrists during the Tit Offensive.  Since
then the feminist dystopia has ruthlessly victimized men, forcing them
into poverty and making the wearing of the fedora a daring and
subversive act.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/kMCp0Rs.gif" alt="I have no idea where this GIF came from." title="Man puts on fedora, nods slowly.  TEXT: \&quot;EUPHORIC\&quot;" />
</p>

<p>But there is hope!  There are still male heroes fighting the
matriarchy and demanding their Man-given rights to be Men.  One such
hero is Emile Nelson, who today authored
<a href="http://dailynexus.com/2013-05-01/boobies-booze-and-batman-3-little-words-that-make-men-melt/" title="Boobies, Booze and Batman: 3 Little Words That Make Men Melt">a treatise on what men deserve from the women they are forced to copulate with</a>, since
it&rsquo;s still illegal for men to
<a href="http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Men_Going_Their_Own_Way" title="Entry for \&quot;Men Going Their Own Way\&quot; on RationalWiki">Go Their Own Way</a>.  Nelson
boldly proclaims, in a section titled &ldquo;Show Up Naked&rdquo;, that</p>

<blockquote>
<p>there are few things [worse] than a girl who is brave enough to take
some control in a relationship.  This means saying what you like,
how you like it, when you like it, where you like it and not being
afraid to be the initiator and get nasty-specific with your boy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The modern woman, drunk on the theories of Lindy West and other
radical feminists, has come to believe that it is her own desires that
matter, rather than those of male columnists in shitty college
newspapers.  They are tragically mistaken, of course, and not only are
ruining the happiness of their male slaves but are in fact acting
contrary to their own interests.  Emile insists that in order for a
woman to have any chance of <em>not</em> dying alone and unloved, &ldquo;you need
to be completely naked in each sense of the word every time you show
up to play with your man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus &ldquo;<strong>boobies</strong>&rdquo; is the first of the &ldquo;words that make men melt.&rdquo;
When Jason Collins, the NBA player who
<a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/magazine/news/20130429/jason-collins-gay-nba-player/" title="Why NBA center Jason Collins is coming out now">came out on Monday</a>, was asked what
makes <em>him</em> melt, he answered&mdash;without hesitation&mdash;&ldquo;boobies&rdquo;.  Upon
being
<a href="https://twitter.com/lenadunham/status/329048636094836738" title="Tweet by @lenadunham on 30 April 2013">threatened with sexual assault by Lena Dunham</a>, Collins dissolved into his
constituent elements.</p>

<p>The second key word identified by Emile Nelson is &ldquo;<strong>beer</strong>.&rdquo;
Discussing <strong>beer</strong>, Nelson writes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As much as guys like to see a lady squeal, it&rsquo;s not always enough to
go home thinking &ldquo;yeaaa I bet she feels good&rdquo; while armies of ninjas
(infamously known as blue balls) slash up your downstairs business.
I don&rsquo;t mean to say that you should never ever let your man go home
unfinished, but please, if you&rsquo;re in a sexual relationship, don&rsquo;t
let his little friend&rsquo;s satisfaction fall to the wayside on a
regular basis.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a novel argument that, for men, <em>sex with a women is an act of
self-defense</em>.  When asked what his greatest fear is, Jason Collins
answered, &ldquo;the little ninjas in my balls, definitely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The third word that, when uttered, imbues men with the power to fight
misandry is &ldquo;<strong>Batman</strong>&ldquo;:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Every single boy has [the same] dreams of [the same] freaky ways he
wishes he could get it on and most of them are harmless and
exciting.  The problem is that far too often, these fantasies are
disregarded because the act itself is &ldquo;good enough.&rdquo;  I&rsquo;m here to
tell you that if you let him wear his Batman mask and talk in the
Dark Knight&rsquo;s voice as he explores your Batcave with his Batmobile,
you will have given that man a memory to be cherished until the end
of time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jason Collins confirmed in his <em>Sports Illustrated</em> interview that his
favorite sexual roleplaying scenario is &ldquo;anything involving Batman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emile Nelson ends
<a href="http://dailynexus.com/2013-05-01/boobies-booze-and-batman-3-little-words-that-make-men-melt/" title="Boobies, Booze and Batman: 3 Little Words That Make Men Melt">his manifesto</a> with a
final warning to any women whose misandry has not been fully
eviscerated by his wise words:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Men are fairly simple creatures; take care of them and they&rsquo;ll take
care of you.  Just remember, ladies, trashy has the word &ldquo;trash&rdquo; in
it for a reason.  Keep it classy until the door closes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, show up naked, but don&rsquo;t, because that would mean
you&rsquo;re a slut.</p>
