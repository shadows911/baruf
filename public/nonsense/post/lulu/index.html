<p>The last time our worthless <a href="drama.html" title="An Unlikely
Friendship">subsidiary</a> bothered to publish something this summer, we were
alarmed to find that it was an unapologetically
<a href="hurdle.html" title="The War On Men Continues">misandrist screed</a> against
the right of men to do whatever they want without jeopardizing the sex
that is also a thing that they have a right to.  We at <em>The Daily
Nonsense</em> apologize for allowing &ldquo;Haley K.&rdquo; a soapbox for her
outrageous opinions, and are happy to announce that we have replaced
her with &ldquo;Hayley E.&rdquo;, who this week has rescued the <em>Nexus</em> tradition
of blaming everything on women.</p>

<p><a href="http://dailynexus.com/2013-08-07/some-things-are-better-left-in-the-bedroom/" title="Some Things are Better Left in the Bedroom">Hayley is concerned in her column</a> about Lulu, a relatively
new app that allows women to anonymously review men in a way that&rsquo;s
been described as
<a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/katieheaney/the-girls-only-yelp-for-boys" title="Katie Heaney: The Girls-Only Yelp For Boys">&ldquo;Yelp for boys&rdquo;</a>.  Hayley sees the app
as part of the ongoing coarsening of our values, driven&mdash;of
course&mdash;by fragile womanly natures:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now, I fully understand why an app like this was created: Some girl
probably got cheated on and said something along the lines of, &ldquo;My
fragile womanly heart has burst asunder!  If only other women knew
the scheming cruel ways of Bobby Whatshisface!&rdquo;  Were these the good
old days, she would&rsquo;ve drenched his possessions in gasoline, lined
them up in the yard to spell &ldquo;ballface&rdquo; or &ldquo;douchenozzle,&rdquo; and then
lit them up like the Fourth of July.  But nowadays, such a simple
act of rebellion does not seem to go far enough in sending a message
to the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At first this may seem like an unintuitive conclusion, for one
imagines that most men would prefer to retain their possessions than
have the #FartMachine hashtag applied to them at OnLulu Dot Com.  But
as Hayley argues, things can be replaced, but a ruined reputation is
forever:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We live in an age where everything we do is permanently stored on
the internet.  That dorky MySpace profile picture where you had
braces and wore your pants too high?  It&rsquo;s up there.  That video
where you tried to do a sexy dance and instead ended up totally
eating it?  It&rsquo;s somewhere in the bowels of the web &hellip; or, if
you&rsquo;re really unlucky, on the front page of YouTube.  And your
romantic endeavors, gross habits and/or traits you&rsquo;d hoped would
never leave the bedroom?  Yep. If you&rsquo;re a man, these, too, are
readily available to the public eye thanks to Lulu.  Guys, be afraid
&hellip; be very afraid.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Before you think that this is overly dramatic, that surely guys
shouldn&rsquo;t worry about anonymous review of dubious authenticity posted
on a single website&mdash;Hayley E. would like to remind you that women
are uniformly shallow and mindless, and will often ignore their own
judgment because of something a stranger said on the internet:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If my little brother falls for a girl in the future and she decides
to look him up on Lulu before their date, she&rsquo;s going to spend the
whole time thinking about his hashtags, judgments fully formed
before so much as talking to him.  She&rsquo;ll look specifically for
those attributes and faults, and when he does something that matches
his description, she&rsquo;ll feel like everything on the page has been
validated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The danger is clear: this perverse and unaccountable system has the
power to render legions of men
<a href="https://twitter.com/puahate_txt/status/354601082309185536" title="Tweet from @PUAHate_txt on 9 July 2013">incel</a>, and angry.  But there may
be a risk to women as well, apart from the possibility of
<a href="http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Men_Going_Their_Own_Way" title="Entry for \&quot;Men Going Their Own Way\&quot; on RationalWiki">men going their own way</a>.  Men may
<em>strike back</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If action isn&rsquo;t taken against Lulu, it&rsquo;s only a matter of time
before there is a male equivalent.  Right now it exists by word of
mouth in places like locker rooms, bars and dorms, where towels are
rat-tailed and there&rsquo;s talk of &ldquo;tapping that.&rdquo;  But soon they could
be detailing your nastiest girl habits and that weird thing you did
in bed (even if it was just that once) for the whole guy-world to
see.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s true: if we&rsquo;re not careful, men might get ideas and start shaming
women on the internet.  Until now they have been kept in check,
following the virtuous example set by women.  But now, Hayley worries,
women may not be women anymore: they have abdicated their
responsibility of reining in male libidos that are too great for men
to control by themselves.  Now that men see themselves betrayed by
women, who knows what they might do?</p>

<p>Perhaps a version of Lulu that allows men to rate women they know.
But men&rsquo;s righteous anger may carry them further.  Although not
wanting to generalize, Hayley generalizes about men&rsquo;s likely behavior,
saying: &ldquo;Not to generalize, but I imagine men would be inclined to be
a tad more explicit with their posts on your page.&rdquo;  She may be right,
however.  It&rsquo;s within the realm of <em>possibility</em> that they might not
only leave &ldquo;reviews&rdquo; of women, but upload
<a href="http://betabeat.com/2012/10/creepshots-reemerges-under-the-guise-of-a-fashion-police-subreddit/" title="Jessica Roy: Creepshots Reemerges Under the Guise of a \'Fashion
Police\' Subreddit">candid photographs</a> of them, publish their

Nudes With Directions to Your House">personal information</a>, and even encourage
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_of_Amanda_Todd" title="Wikipedia: Suicide of Amanda Todd">ruthless bullying</a>.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s <em>possible</em> that all this could happen.  So women, <em>shape up</em>.
Because <em>if</em> it does happen, it will be your fault for using a novelty
app in order to say that a guy is #Boring.</p>
