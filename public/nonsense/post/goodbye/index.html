<p>It&rsquo;s a sad day.  Mr Jeffrey Robin, whose intriguing piece of analytic
philosophy was the subject of
<a href="robin.html" title="Critical discussion of a metaphysical thesis recently proposed by
Mr. Robin">the very first essay published by the <em>Nonsense</em></a>, is stepping down from his position as Reactionary Bigot
at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p>

<p>He begins with some
<a href="http://dailynexus.com/2013-05-28/right-side-columnist-bids-ucsb-farewell/" title="Right-Side Columnist Bids UCSB Farewell">misty-eyed remembrances</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be perfectly honest&mdash;UCSB wasn&rsquo;t my first choice, by far.  I
came out of high school the preppy, sarcastic valedictorian of a
sleepy suburb no one&rsquo;s heard of.  Despite receiving the Regents
Scholarship here, I was sure that I was off to Pomona College in
Claremont.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Being valedictorian of an entire suburb is a remarkable
accomplishment, and while I share Mr Robin&rsquo;s astonishment that he was
not accepted at a more prestigious institution, I am incredibly
grateful that we at UCSB have been blessed with his presence.  It
seems that he, too, has gained from his association with public-school
leeches:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Getting waitlisted at every private school I wanted to go to gave me
the greatest lesson in humility I think I have ever experienced. But
as I sit here writing an article I&rsquo;ve been thinking about for
months, I don&rsquo;t think I could be more glad for it.</p>

<p>My time at UCSB has profoundly changed me in ways I could never have
anticipated. It flipped me upside down.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Such is the power of education.  When you leave your sleepy suburb and
enter a state university, not only are you exposed to new ideas in
your classes, but you come into contact with <em>people</em> that you haven&rsquo;t
met before, people whose backgrounds and worldviews differ sharply
from your own.  Being able to learn from the experiences of others,
especially from those less privileged than yourself, is a huge
opportunity to become a better and more tolerant person.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I could not even imagine myself listening to country music.  Now,
country line and swing dancing is the single most time-consuming
hobby I have.  Once the prudish, smart-guy type who confused
everyone with his diction, I&rsquo;ve caught myself using the word &ldquo;brah&rdquo;
perhaps a little more than I&rsquo;d like.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But perhaps my personal beliefs have undergone the greatest and most
counterintuitive changes.  I came here convinced of Ayn Randian
philosophy and pure libertarian ideology, totally having bought in
to the populism of Ron Paul (Tea Party before it was cool).  Now,
perhaps to your chagrin, I am the strictest of elitist
constitutional conservatives, an advocate of the Empire of Liberty.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Truly a wrenching change!  I can hardly imagine a situation better
described as being &ldquo;flipped upside down&rdquo;, except perhaps the
transformation involved in moving from the Socialist Equality Party to
the International Socialist Organization (a process that invariably
destroys friendships).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Most importantly, in a time when many in our country are
increasingly antagonistic to the idea of God, I moved from a tepid
agnosticist and occasional deist to a strong believer in Christ.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A daring admission to make in these hateful, secular times.  But I
doubt he will come under too much fire, as long as he doesn&rsquo;t use his
new-found faith to justify
<a href="http://dailynexus.com/2012-02-15/contest-government-almighty-judge-soul/" title="\&quot;A Contest Over Whether Your Government or the Almighty is the Judge
of Your Soul\&quot;">vicious attacks on the rights of others</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As I close, I exhort you all to not intertwine or falsely associate
our faith with politics, as easy as it might be.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Too late.</p>

<p>Mr Jeffrey Robin ends his tenure at the <em>Nexus</em> fittingly, with a
quote that he doesn&rsquo;t seem to really understand:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every
form of tyranny over the mind of man&rdquo;</em> &mdash; Thomas Jefferson</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The tyranny that Jefferson speaks of here is
<a href="http://etext.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=JefLett.sgm&amp;images=images/modeng&amp;data=/texts/english/modeng/parsed&amp;tag=public&amp;part=133&amp;division=div1" title="Letter to To Dr. Benjamin Rush, Sep. 23, 1800">that of organized Christianity</a>, were it allowed to
be established as a state religion.  But if Jeffrey realized
this&mdash;that the hero he quotes is arguing <em>against</em> the sort of thing
that would allow Christian institutions to
<a href="http://dailynexus.com/2012-02-15/contest-government-almighty-judge-soul/" title="\&quot;A Contest Over Whether Your Government or the Almighty is the Judge
of Your Soul\&quot;">deny women basic reproductive rights</a>&mdash;then he would not be our beloved Mr Robin.</p>

<p>We will miss him <em>very</em> much.</p>
