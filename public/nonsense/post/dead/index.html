<h1>Halloween Comes Early at the *Nexus*</h1>

<p>Dr Edwin Feliciano, a self-proclaimed &ldquo;psychiatrist&rdquo; at UCSB, today
appears to be attempting
<a href="http://dailynexus.com/2013-05-22/anatomy-of-an-overdose/" title="Anatomy of an Overdose">a séance in the pages of the <em>Nexus</em></a>, and reports to us a story told by the dead.
Let us refer to the ghostly narrator as &ldquo;Edwin&rdquo;:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am dead.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the words of one commenter, <a href="http://dailynexus.com/2013-05-22/anatomy-of-an-overdose/comment-page-1/#comment-172755">&ldquo;Cool story, bro.&rdquo;</a></p>

<p>But how did Edwin die?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s one pill, man?&rdquo; said my friend.  &ldquo;People take six of those a
day for pain.&rdquo;  I looked at it.  It was white, oval-shaped and
promised a good time.  Two hours later I was in bed, unable to
breathe.  My friends thought I was just passed out&mdash;something that
happens a lot at college parties. Hell, I had seen it so many times
too!  Why would something go wrong then?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It shouldn&rsquo;t come as a surprise that Edwin isn&rsquo;t the brightest bulb,
but it&rsquo;s rather alarming that Dr Feliciano doesn&rsquo;t pause in his
spirit-channeling to point out that there are rather a lot of reasons
why <em>something would go wrong</em> when a person passes out at a party.
I can only assume that the good doctor knows something we don&rsquo;t (and I
guess that&rsquo;s to be expected, given that <em>he&rsquo;s</em> the one who can commune
with the dead).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When the doctors discussed my &ldquo;case&rdquo; after I died, one doc said,
&ldquo;This is outrageous.  Too many kids die from this. How stupid can a
person be?&rdquo;  I was angry, but I hung around and listened to their
&ldquo;expert analysis.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&ldquo;Expert&rdquo; is rightly enclosed in quotation marks, because these doctors
probably don&rsquo;t even believe in ghosts.  But more interesting are the
quotes around &ldquo;case&rdquo;.  What is Dead Edwin trying to tell us?  Was
there no real case?  Let us proceed with caution, dear reader.</p>

<p>The dead man&rsquo;s story continues with some bizarrely pedagogic
ruminations on his so-called case, and the claim that &ldquo;what I learned
may help you stay alive.&rdquo;  That&rsquo;s a rather strange thing to tell a
doctor, but Edwin Feliciano apparently doesn&rsquo;t realize that a
passed-out person might be in trouble, so I suppose he could use the
advice.</p>

<p>As we reach the conclusion, though, a careful reader gets the
impression that this is not the monologue of a normal (if deceased)
19-year-old:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The rest of the explanation got too technical for me.  By then, I
didn&rsquo;t care to understand the &ldquo;physiological&rdquo; causes of my death.
It boiled down to this: there is a difference between what you feel
psychologically&mdash;relaxed, buzzed, happy&mdash;and what your body is
experiencing internally.  While it may be easy to gauge your mood,
alcohol and drugs are accumulating in your system at a rate faster
than your body can metabolize them.  The fact is that the effects
are delayed, so when you have one more shot, or an Adderall, or a
Norco, you&rsquo;re creating a unique, often deadly cocktail in your
body. That&rsquo;s what happened to me.  I got the message too late, which
is, very simply, that mixing drugs will kill you, period.</p>

<p>I should have stayed home watching the Sixers play the Knicks and
having a few beers with my friends. I didn&rsquo;t, as you now know, but
you have a choice.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This sounds less like the lament of a soul who is mourning the loss of
its body than a school psychiatrist who is insulting the intelligence
of his patients by making obviously false claims that lead students to
dismiss his advice&mdash;and therefore be <em>more</em> likely to make risky
decisions&mdash;instead of explaining accurately how common drugs interact
and urging young people to educate themselves about the effects of
what they put in their bodies.</p>

<p>So maybe ghosts don&rsquo;t exist after all.  They&rsquo;re just another thing Dr
Feliciano made up to scare us.</p>
