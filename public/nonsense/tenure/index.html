<p>As an admirer of fine dissimulation, it was with great pride that I
read Brett Debbold&rsquo;s
<a href="http://thebottomline.as.ucsb.edu/2014/01/teacher-tenure-only-good-in-theory" title="Teacher Tenure: Only Good in Theory">recent piece on tenure</a> in the <em>Bottom Line</em>.  With
such young prodigies (or should we say
&ldquo;<a href="http://www.theawl.com/2014/01/better-than-ezra" title="Better
then Ezra"><em>wunderkinder</em></a>&rdquo;), we need not worry about the advancing age of some of
our current <a href="http://sbshit.com/wage.html" title="What Is The
Point Of A Living Wage If We Are Not Truly Alive">sleeper agents</a>.</p>

<p>Mr. Debbold&rsquo;s
<a href="http://thebottomline.as.ucsb.edu/2014/01/teacher-tenure-only-good-in-theory" title="Teacher Tenure: Only Good in Theory">article</a>, titled &ldquo;Teacher Tenure: Only
Good in Theory&rdquo;, is, of course, actually a cleverly-disguised attack
on the underlying logic of capitalism.  That&rsquo;s something Harris
Sherline already did very well, but the angle of tenured employment is
new, so we will forgive Brett.  And his piece itself is admirably
straightforward, setting up the dialectic in the very first sentence:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Tenure, much like communism, is a good idea in theory, but its
modern application does more harm than good for teachers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If we&rsquo;re using the standard John Birch Model, then communism is on the
opposite end of the economic freedom spectrum from capitalism.  By
comparing tenure to capitalism, we are to understand it as
antithetical to the principles of capitalism.  The existence of tenure
will necessarily be precarious in a capitalistic system, as Mr. Debbold
points out:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The goal of tenure is to protect proven teachers from dismissal when
new administrations or young teachers come into their schools
[or they express controversial opinions in their classrooms; or they criticize the existing administration; or they speak out against racism, sexism, or other sorts of discrimination; or they come out as gay, lesbian, transgender, etc.; or they <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/13/us/anita-hill-plans-to-leave-teaching-post-in-oklahoma.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm">find themselves in a political firestorm</a>].
The fear is that without tenure, older teachers will be unjustly
pushed out in order to save the school money or because of
conflicting teaching theory
[or because they express controversial opinions in their classrooms; or because they criticize the existing administration; or because they speak out against racism, sexism, or other sorts of discrimination; or because they come out as gay, lesbian, transgender, etc.; or because they find themselves in a political firestorm].</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Having established so clearly the great value of tenure, Mr. Debbold&rsquo;s
rhetorical strategy is to lay forth the common arguments against
tenure and simply allow the reader to see how ludicrous they are in
the light of what has already been said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For the most part, the teachers who would deserve to keep their jobs
would do so easily even without tenure. Just like in any other
profession, there is no reason for an administration to fire good
employees.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Certainly, no reason at all!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Tenure does, however, give license to those who have earned it to
become complacent in their work. Of course not every tenured teacher
lets his or her work decline, but it is an easy course to
take. Knowing that you can’t be fired for anything less than a
serious offense is a dangerous thing. The fear of getting fired and
the desire to get promoted are the most common incentives for good
work, and with tenure, many teachers are left without either.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As an anecdotal aside, 100% of my fellow graduate students have
actually informed me that they&rsquo;re dedicating the majority of their
twenties to become experts in a field they are truly passionate about
just so they can play Candy Crush a lot when they get tenure.  But
like
<a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume/#Emp" title="SEP: Hume: Empiricism">Hume&rsquo;s missing shade of blue</a>, I don&rsquo;t think this data point should be
given much weight.  In any case, here is the heart of Brett&rsquo;s essay:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Worse than that, tenure forces schools to fire superior teachers for
the sole reason that they haven’t been around as long as their
peers. When merit is no longer the basis for which firings are
decided, something is wrong with the system. When schools inevitably
undergo cutbacks and inferior teachers remain employed while young
teachers excited to go to work are let go, tenure is to blame.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They key word here is &ldquo;inevitable&rdquo;.  In a capitalist society, the
expansion of higher education following World War Two was in fact an
anomaly, and the current funding cuts, privatization, and rise of the
adjunct labor class should be seen as the more natural phenomena.
Anyone feeling mystified as to why our government is not even
considering straightforward and relatively inexpensive reforms that
would make education
<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/01/heres-exactly-how-much-the-government-would-have-to-spend-to-make-public-college-tuition-free/282803/" title="Here's Exactly How Much the Government Would Have to Spend to Make
Public College Tuition-Free">truly free for all</a> does not fully appreciate the economic
and political pressures, created by capitalism, that rule out this
obvious solution.  Likewise, the sensible job protections offered by
tenure are anathema to capitalism, and so have been strategically
associated with lazy, overpaid, unqualified professors.</p>

<p>As if to drive home the absurdity of this last charge, Brett Debbold
ends with a comparison of tenured teachers with Supreme Court
Justices:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Teaching is a far cry from the Supreme Court, where job security is
necessary to ensure job performance</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was, of course, a certain member of that judicial body whose sexual
harassment created the aforementioned political firestorm around
<em>tenured professor</em> Anita Hill, who was saved from retaliatory
termination of her employment due to her tenure.</p>

<p>A far cry, indeed.</p>
