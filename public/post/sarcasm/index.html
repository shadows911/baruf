<p>Dear Jed A. Hendrickson, CM, AICA: Thank you for
<a href="http://www.santabarbaraview.com/saved-from-the-scourge-of-plastic-bags452524542/" title="Saved from the Scourge of Plastic Bags">saving us</a> from the scourge of going
another week without something to make fun of in Santa Barbara (please
do not read with any sarcasm, we&rsquo;re absolutely sincere and in fact
have never been sarcastic ever).</p>

<p>Perhaps now we can try to do something useful for the citizens and
businesses in Santa Barbara&mdash;by laughing at your
<a href="http://www.santabarbaraview.com/saved-from-the-scourge-of-plastic-bags452524542/" title="Saved from the Scourge of Plastic Bags">letter to the editor</a>.</p>

<p>I have attached a photo of the &ldquo;attached&rdquo; photos that you included
with your letter.  The fact that a web-only publication can fail, in
2013, to correctly embed images in a blog post paints a sad picture of
what is allowed to happen when the <em>Santa Barbara View</em> is allowed to
operate without regard to the impact on the community.  I realize that
using a PDF to display images is hardly a big deal except it seems to
happen every day (unlike the presence of homeless individuals around
Jed&rsquo;s business, given the gaps in his photographic record).</p>

</p>

<p>If it were not for us at <em>Santa Barbara Bullshit</em> I fear the City
would take the <em>View</em> seriously.</p>

<p>I ask the City Council to do more to marginalize the
<a href="home.html" title="Point-Counterpoint: Kill the
Homeless, or Just Treat Them Like Animals?">privileged and hateful</a> members of the local
community in the Milpas Street area.
<a href="liberal.html" title="A New Argument for Moral Relativism">Sharon Byrne in particular</a>
should be held to a strict standard (only one article or letter per
month); police budgets should be slashed to reduce the victimization
of the oppressed for the comfort of the rich; and finally the City
needs to recognize the burden it carries as a government complicit in
the continued production of conditions that create homelessness.</p>
