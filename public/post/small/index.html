<h1>A Small Business Success (Take That, Obama!)</h1>

<section class="single">
<p>Life has not been easy for small business owners of the Caucasian
persuasion since Black Spy Barack Hussein Obama passed the Reparations
Act of Reverse Racism (RARR!).  Good, hardworking Americans have found
their already-shrinking incomes further taxed to pay for the data
plans of Obamaphones, which are then used by Welfare-Americans to shop
online and put local stores out of business.  Just such a fate
recently befell area White man Jan Koch (relationship to the Koch
brothers unknown), whose Travel Store is
<a href="http://www.noozhawk.com/article/travel_store_closes_doors_after_29_years/" title="Travel Store of Santa Barbara Packing It In After 29 Years">closing its doors this month</a>.</p>

<p>But despite the increasingly dystopian nature of the country as it
slides toward an inevitable race war, some hero entrepreneurs have
refused to take the easy way out (food stamps) and have valiantly
started a profitable business despite the best efforts of the Obama
regime.  Success has not come easily for
<a href="http://sbmag.com/2013/06/15556/" title="Santa
Barbara Magazine: Jet Set">David and Healey Young</a>, who live a Spartan existence while their
pour all their resources into staying afloat.</p>

<p><img src="http://sbmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Screen-shot-2013-06-14-at-11.19.33-AM.png" alt="The Youngs in their sparsely-furnished home, [from Santa Barbara Magazine](http://sbmag.com/2013/06/15556/ &quot;Santa
Barbara Magazine: Jet Set&quot;)" title="Screen-shot-2013-06-14-at-11.19.33-AM.png" />
</p>

<p>The severe difficulties that the Youngs have faced have given them a
humble, grounded perspective on life.  Says Healey:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I love classics toughened up with edgy pieces. I&rsquo;ll pair a checkered
oxford with a pouf skirt and insanely high ankle-risking Lanvin
wedges.  I love L.A. designer Gladys Tamez&rsquo;s hats. And vintage pool
dresses when they&rsquo;re least expected.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>David is equally modest, admitting only with embarrassment that &ldquo;I
discovered the Santa Barbara-band Dishwalla, so I have a gold record
for their first album <em>Pet Your Friends</em>.&rdquo;  He also makes a
self-conscious reference to his signed poster of Green Day&rsquo;s <em>American
Idiot</em>.  It is rumored that the album name is in fact a reference to
David Young.</p>

<p>The vocation that the Youngs have sacrificed everything for is a
thankless one.  They run a private &ldquo;jet charter service&rdquo;&mdash;a
misleading title for a business that is little more than an air taxi
operator.  David and Healey fly the planes themselves, and are
continually at the mercy of
<a href="http://popdust.com/2012/11/19/rihanna-air-naked-in-the-aisles/" title="Pop Dust: Air Rihanna: Nudity, Talk of Mutiny and the Smell of Hot
Processed Cheese and Fear">Obama&rsquo;s nouveau rich</a>.  Often they are treated as glorified UPS
drivers; David recalls the humiliation he felt when he &ldquo;flew a tuxedo
to its owner on a Citation X, the world&rsquo;s fastest civilian jet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For all their suffering, the two refuse to go into detail about the
debauched behavior of their passengers:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What happens at 40,000 feet stays at 40,000 feet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But their reticence may only be due to the fact that their livelihood
is continually at risk&mdash;one disgruntled call from an Obamaphone could
put them on the streets.</p>
