<h1>Art Critic: How Is This House Floating?</h1>

<main id="content-start" role="main">

<section class="single">
<p><em>This is the first (and, hopefully, last) installment of</em> Art Critic,
<em>in which we attempt a negative definition of art by excluding
everything in Santa Barbara.</em></p>

<hr />

<p>Steve Greenberg is widely thought to be a cartoonist, but there has
historically been little evidence supporting that claim.  This week,
however, the <em>Santa Barbara View</em> threw their weight behind the
credibility of rumors that Greenberg in fact draws pictures,
accompanied with text, that aim to provide humorous commentary on
current political affairs.  By reprinting his piece
&ldquo;<a href="http://www.santabarbaraview.com/toon-op-housing-bubble-ii6536356/">Housing Bubble 2</a>&rdquo;,
which first appeared in the <em>Ventura Star</em>
<a href="http://www.greenberg-art.com/.Toons/.Toons%20recent/HousingBubble.html">last month</a>,
the suggestion is that the work meets enough of the criteria listed
above to be considered a &ldquo;political cartoon&rdquo;.</p>

<p><img src="img/speculator.png" alt="His bubble wand is colored gold in order to symbolize his wealth (this is because gold is associated with wealth because it is valuable)" />
</p>

<p>What first captures the viewer&rsquo;s attention is this man in the bottom
left.  He is labeled &ldquo;SPECULATORS&rdquo;, implying that he represents multiple
speculators.  But which speculators?</p>

<p><img src="img/house.png" alt="The house has curved walls because it is inside a bubble, which distorts light and creates that sort of illusion" />
</p>

<p>The second large element of &ldquo;Housing Bubble 2&rdquo; makes it clear that our
topic is <em>housing</em> speculators, who attempt to leverage fluctuations
in real estate prices in order to make money quickly.  This practice
can artificially &ldquo;inflate&rdquo; house prices and create a housing
&ldquo;bubble&rdquo;&mdash;represented above by the house inside a bubble.  The house,
inside the bubble, rising up in the air, represents the rising house
prices.</p>

<p><img src="img/homebuyer.png" alt="The man on the roof represents the would-be-homebuyer whose dream house is &quot;slipping away&quot; (it would be visually uninteresting to show the worth of the house in contrast to the would-be-homebuyer's means, so the cartoonist shows him *on* the house, but slipping off it)" />
</p>

<p>As a result of the &ldquo;bubble&rdquo;, lower- and middle-class individuals may
find themselves no longer able to afford to purchase a house.</p>

<p><img src="img/words.png" alt="Don't imagine that these words are actually painted on the house, because it's supposed to be a good-looking house that the would-be-homebuyer wants to buy" />
</p>

<p>The &ldquo;2&rdquo; at the end of &ldquo;Housing Bubble 2&rdquo; (which is also the title of
the drawing) is supposed to inform us that this is the second housing
bubble that has occurred.  Another housing bubble happened a while
ago.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the <em>Santa Barbara View</em> is correct.  This is a
cartoon, it&rsquo;s a good cartoon, and it is funny.  It&rsquo;s funny because
it&rsquo;s funny to imagine a grown man blowing a bubble wand, and a house
floating in the air.  Considered alongside his
<a href="http://www.santabarbaraview.com/toon-op-school-funding654363/">last drawing</a>,
which was funny because some places have a larger property tax base
than others, there is little doubt that Steve Greenberg is a very
funny political cartoonist.</p>
