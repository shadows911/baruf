<h1>Why Is Paul Burri Allowed Near A Keyboard?  And Other Smart Questions</h1>
</header>

<section class="single">
<p>Local entrepreneur, inventor, columnist, engineer, guerrilla marketer
and iconoclast Paul Burri is running out of ideas
(<a href="http://www.noozhawk.com/article/112512_paul_burri_have_nothing_to_say" title="When You Have Nothing to Say">this isn&rsquo;t the first time</a>).  In his <em>Noozhawk</em> column, which he
has apparently mistaken for a Tumblr, he&rsquo;s already written about that
time he
<a href="http://www.noozhawk.com/article/021013_paul_burri_the_great_frying_pan_mystery" title="Cracking the Case of the Great Frying Pan Mystery">poached an egg</a>, that time he
<a href="http://www.noozhawk.com/article/012013_paul_burri_the_electric_blanket_mix-up" title="The Electric Blanket Mix-Up Unfolds">didn&rsquo;t make the bed correctly</a>, that time he went to Israel
and
<a href="http://www.noozhawk.com/article/123012_paul_burri_recent_trip_to_israel" title="Observations After Our Recent Trip to Israel">decided that the Palestinians could learn a lot from the Israelis</a>, that time he got
annoyed when
<a href="http://www.noozhawk.com/article/101412_paul_burri_why_didi_he_do_that" title="Questioning Why People Do the Things They Do">someone talked about him</a>, that time he
<a href="http://www.noozhawk.com/article/081912_paul_burri_words_i_think_need_to_be_invented" title="Words I Think Need to Be Invented">made up words</a>, and that time when
<a href="http://www.noozhawk.com/article/042113_paul_burri_santa_barbara_homeless" title="An Unconventional Solution to Santa Barbara’s Transient Problem">he suggested that Santa Barbara conscript people into performing manual labor and then forcibly remove them from town</a>.</p>

<p>There really isn&rsquo;t much more to talk about, but
<a href="http://www.noozhawk.com/article/090212_paul_burri_man_killed_defective_toilet_seat" title="Man Killed by Defective Toilet Seat">that hasn&rsquo;t stopped dear Paul before</a>.  This week Paul titled his
piece
<a href="http://www.noozhawk.com/article/paul_burri_dumb_questions" title="Actually, There Are Such Things as Dumb Questions">&ldquo;Actually, There Are Such Things as Dumb Questions&rdquo;</a>, playing on
<a href="http://bitchmagazine.org/post/the-transcontinental-disability-choir-what-is-ableist-language-and-why-should-you-care" title="The Transcontinental Disability Choir: What is Ableist Language and
Why Should You Care?">an ableist slur</a> to make the point that he has nothing
interesting left to say:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Whenever I am in a lecture or an adult-ed class, my hand is always
one of the first to go up when we get to the Q&amp;A part of the
program. And often, afterward, people frequently come up to me and
thank me for asking a question they were too timid to ask. I am sure
that whatever question you have on your mind, there are several
others in the audience who have the same question but hesitate
because it might be a &ldquo;dumb question.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At the risk of
<a href="http://www.noozhawk.com/article/paul_burri_whats_so_funny" title="What's So Funny?">explaining the joke</a>, this works on two levels.  After having railed
against the plague of &ldquo;dumb&rdquo; questions, it&rsquo;s suddenly revealed that
Paul Burri asks a lot of them himself.  And the people who have to
answer his questions probably can&rsquo;t stop themselves from wishing he
was dumb in the literal sense.  But that wouldn&rsquo;t stop him from typing.</p>

<p>I have nothing more to say about Paul Burri.</p>
