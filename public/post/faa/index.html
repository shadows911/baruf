<a href="https://twitter.com/adeerable/status/347688205337911296" title="Tweet from @adeerable on 20 June 2013">Serious</a> of problems: the zombie
menace.  As any student of anti-zombie strategy knows, the most
important thing is to quickly identify and eliminate infected members
of your community.  Therefore I feel compelled to warn Santa Barbara
residents that our own Craig Smith may be a zombie.</p>

<p>The evidence comes in the form of today&rsquo;s blog post, in which <a href="http://craigsmithsblog.blogspot.com/2013/06/the-mile-high-club-needs-to-stay.html" title="The Mile High Club Needs to Stay Powered Down">he
appears to admit to having &ldquo;died&rdquo;</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When it comes to electronic gadgets and devices, I&rsquo;m a little like
Charlton Heston was when it came to his gun.  The only way you are
going to take my iPhone away from me is to, &ldquo;pry it from my cold,
dead hand.&rdquo;  The same goes for my iPad and my Nexus 7 tablet.
However, despite my attachment to these gadgets, I think the time
and energy spent by the FAA on repealing the rule that electronic
devices need to be powered off and put away during take-off and
landing is a bad idea.  The rule as it stands (&ldquo;if it has an on/off
switch it needs to be off) is just fine.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Craig Smith will only stop using his iPhone when he is &ldquo;dead&rdquo;, but he
<em>has</em> stopped using his phone when flying!  The only possibility is
that he goes into some sort of zombie fugue when boarding an
airplane.  What is most shocking about this revelation is the fact
that he apparently recovers upon landing.  Traditionally, zombies have
been thought to be permanently undead.  This is a disturbing
development.</p>

<p>(Many of you will point out that Smith says he only dies when his
phone is taken from his hands, not when it is turned off.  True
enough, but the implication is clear.  It would be a gross non
sequitur to make such a claim in the context of a discussion of the
FAA&rsquo;s rules for the use of electronics.)</p>

<p>A zombie on an airplane is a terrifying idea, for it allows the rapid
spread of contagion.  Warnings about public safety, therefore, sound
pretty hollow coming from Smith:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If indeed, the most critical time on an airplane is during take-off
and landing shouldn&rsquo;t passengers be ready to be alerted to the
possibility that an emergency is imminent?  You shouldn&rsquo;t be playing
Angry Birds and be oblivious to the fact that everyone else is
panicked because the bird you are flying on is going down.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But this clumsy attempt to deflect attention from his own disease only
further highlights Smith&rsquo;s affliction.  No passenger could be so
engrossed in a game to fail to notice that their plane is crashing;
but Smith, being always zombified during flight, is not aware of this.
Likewise he does not realize that electronic devices are allowed to be
on during the majority of the flight, proclaiming that &ldquo;if they ever
allow passengers to talk on cell phones during the flight, I&rsquo;ll be
done with flying.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s hope Craig Smith does stop flying, for the good of us all.  In
particular, though, it may make the flight attendants more
comfortable:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I remember a few years ago I was on a plane about to depart from JFK
when a passenger was still gabbing on her cell phone even though the
flight attendants were giving the safety instructions and the plane
was taxiing down the runway.  Apparently this passenger didn&rsquo;t find
the &ldquo;Delta Girl&rdquo; anywhere near as captivating as I do.</p>
