<p>Until <em>Deathly Hallows</em>, we all thought <em>Expelliarmus</em> was just a
nifty spell that causes people to drop their wands and sometimes
knocks them over (which is why we had all those Tower Truthers saying
that <a href="http://www.beyondhogwarts.com/harry-potter/articles/dumbledore-clues.html" title="Beyond Hogwarts">Dumbledore wasn&rsquo;t
dead</a>).
But then it turns out that it&rsquo;s <em>totally bonkers</em>. Apparently
disarming someone actually <em>transfers their wand&rsquo;s loyalty to you</em>.</p>

<p>This is totally bonkers because <em>everybody disarms everybody</em> at some
point.  So to figure out whose wand is whose and what <em>really</em>
happened, let&rsquo;s catalog every instance of disarming ever!</p>

<p>Before we do that, though, we need to figure out when exactly a wand
changes owners.</p>

<p>Well, maybe not <em>exactly.</em></p>

<h2 id="toc_0">Disarming for Dummies</h2>

<p>For some reason Harry has to finish He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named in the
<em>very same way</em> that he beats You-Know-Who when he&rsquo;s only a baby;
namely, by having Lord Thingy&rsquo;s <em>Avada Kedavra</em> bounce off the Chosen
Boy like he&rsquo;s some sort of magic mirror. In order to pull it off,
Rowling drops this tidbit on us two-thirds of the way through
<em>Deathly Hallows</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Hawthorn and unicorn hair. Ten inches precisely. Reasonably
springy. This was the wand of Draco Malfoy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was?&rdquo; repeated Harry. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it still his?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not. If you took it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&rdquo;&mdash;I did&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&rdquo;&mdash;then it may be yours.  Of course, the manner of taking matters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I took this wand from Draco Malfoy by force,&rdquo; said Harry.  &ldquo;Can I
use it safely?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think so. Subtle laws govern wand ownership, but the conquered
wand will usually bend its will to its new master&rdquo; (<em>DH</em> 334&ndash;335).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you&rsquo;re prone to fits of charitability, you might think that all
this means is that, when you disarm someone else by force and take
their wand, <em>eventually</em> the wand <em>might</em> &ldquo;bend its will&rdquo; to you.</p>

<p>But you would be wrong! Check out this exchange from Harry&rsquo;s rap
battle with Voldy:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;You still don&rsquo;t get it, Riddle, do you? Possessing the wand isn&rsquo;t
enough!  Holding it, using it, doesn&rsquo;t make it really yours.  Didn&rsquo;t
you listen to Ollivander?  <em>The wand chooses the wizard</em> &hellip; the
Elder Wand recognised a new master before Dumbledore died, someone
who never even laid a hand on it.  The new master removed the wand
from Dumbledore against his will, never realising exactly what he
had done, or that the world&rsquo;s most dangerous wand had given him its
allegiance &hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Voldemort&rsquo;s chest rose and fell rapidly, and Harry could feel the
curse coming, feel it building inside the wand pointed at his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The true master of the Elder Wand was Draco Malfoy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Blank shock showed in Voldemort&rsquo;s face for a moment, but then it was
gone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what does it matter?&rdquo; he said softly. &ldquo;Even if you are right,
Potter, it makes no difference to you and me.  You no longer have
the phoenix wand: we duel on skill alone &hellip; and after I have killed
you, I can attend to Draco Malfoy &hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re too late,&rdquo; said Harry.  &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve missed your chance.  I
got there first.  I overpowered Draco weeks ago.  I took this wand
from him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Harry twitched the hawthorn wand, and he felt the eyes of everyone
in the Hall upon it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So it all comes down to this, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; whispered Harry.  &ldquo;Does
the wand in your hand know its last master was Disarmed?  Because if
it does &hellip; I am the true master of the Elder Wand&rdquo; (<em>DH</em> 497).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You don&rsquo;t even have to <em>touch</em> a wand to win it. And not only that,
when you disarm someone <em>you get all the wands </em><em>they&rsquo;ve</em>* won*.
That&rsquo;s how Harry gets the Elder Wand by disarming Draco, even though
it&rsquo;s tucked away in Dumbledore&rsquo;s tomb.</p>

<p>But at least you do have to disarm the other person <em>by force</em>, like
Ollivander says, right?  WRONG AGAIN:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And now Harry was hurrying along a dark corridor in stout little
Gregorovitch&rsquo;s wake as he held a lantern aloft: Gregorovitch burst
into the room at the end of the passage and his lantern illuminated
what looked like a workshop; wood-shavings and gold gleamed in the
swinging pool of light, and there on the window ledge sat perched,
like a giant bird, a young man with golden hair.  In the split
second that the lantern&rsquo;s light illuminated him, Harry saw the
delight upon his handsome face, then the intruder shot a Stunning
Spell from his wand and jumped neatly backwards out of the window
with a crow of laughter (<em>DH</em> 194).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Grindelwald wins the Elder Wand by just sneaking into Gregorovitch&rsquo;s
bedroom and nicking it.</p>

<p>Now, we could get into fussy debates over <em>intention</em>, and <em>malice</em>,
and try to lay down some criteria for when nabbing someone else&rsquo;s
wand <em>really counts</em> as &ldquo;disarming&rdquo; them and so transfers the
ownership.</p>

<p>But that would be <em>boring</em>. Let&rsquo;s just assume that anyone who grabs
someone else&rsquo;s wand or otherwise disarms them gains ownership of
every wand that person owns.</p>

<p>So, which wands belong to who?</p>

<h2 id="toc_1">Swaps that happen before Harry starts at Hogwarts</h2>

<p>We just saw how Grindelwald steals the Elder wand from Gregorovitch.
Let&rsquo;s write that down:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Grindelwald</strong> has Gregorovitch&rsquo;s and his own wands.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Gregorovitch</strong> has nothing.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><em>DH</em> 482:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I think he knew it, I think he knew what frightened me.  I delayed
meeting him until, finally, it would have been too shameful to
resist any longer.  People were dying and he seemed unstoppable, and
I had to do what I could.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you know what happened next.  I won the duel. I won the
wand.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Dumbledore</strong> has Grindelwald&rsquo;s, Gregorovitch&rsquo;s and his own wands.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Grindelwald</strong> has nothing.  He lost Dumbledore long ago.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><em>OotP</em> 476:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Snape reacted so fast it was as though he had been expecting an
attack: dropping his bag, he plunged his hand inside his robes and
his wand was halfway into the air when James shouted,
&ldquo;<em>Expelliarmus!</em>&ldquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Poor Snivellus can never catch a break.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>James</strong> has Snape&rsquo;s and his own wands.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Snape</strong> has nothing. No wand, no dignity (we all saw his undies,
remember?), no Lily.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><em>DH</em> 454:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Then a blinding, jagged jet of white light flew through the air:
Harry thought of lightning, but Snape had dropped to his knees and
his wand had flown out of his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t kill me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was not my intention.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Any sound of Dumbledore Apparating had been drowned by the sound of
the wind in the branches.  He stood before Snape with his robes
whipping around him, and his face was illuminated from below in the
light cast by his wand.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This doesn&rsquo;t sound like an <em>Expelliarmus</em>; Dumbledore&rsquo;s too weird for
any normal spells. It&rsquo;s certainly some sort of disarming,
but&mdash;woops&mdash;James already disarmed Snivellus. Snape doesn&rsquo;t own his
wand anymore.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how things stand going into the first book:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>James</strong> has Snape&rsquo;s and his own wands.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Snape</strong> has nothing.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Dumbledore</strong> has Grindelwald&rsquo;s, Gregorovitch&rsquo;s and his own wands.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Grindelwald</strong> has nothing.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Gregorovitch</strong> has nothing.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_2"><em>Philosopher&rsquo;s Stone</em></h2>

<p><em>PS</em> 121:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hermione had sunk to the floor in fright; Ron pulled out his own
wand&mdash;not knowing what he was going to do he heard himself cry the
first spell that came into his head: &ldquo;<em>Wingardium Leviosa!</em>&ldquo;</p>

<p>The club flew suddenly out of the troll&rsquo;s hand, rose high, high up
into the air, turned slowly over&mdash;and dropped, with a sickening
crack, on to its owner&rsquo;s head.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because why should we limit this to wands? How very close-minded. The
wand chooses the wizard, but the club chooses the mindless death
machine, too. (Ron is pretty mindless, so the club chose well here.)</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Ron</strong> has the troll&rsquo;s club and his own wand.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_3"><em>Chamber of Secrets</em></h2>

<p><em>CoS</em> 130:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Both of them swung their wands up and over their shoulders. Snape
cried: &ldquo;<em>Expelliarmus!</em>&rdquo;  There was a dazzling flash of scarlet light
and Lockhart was blasted off his feet: he flew backwards off the
stage, smashed into the wall and slid down it to sprawl on the
floor.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Good for Snivellus, he owns a wand again!</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Snape</strong> has Lockhart&rsquo;s wand.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Lockhart</strong> has nothing but his looks.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><em>CoS</em> 162:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Percy said, &ldquo;As a school Prefect&mdash;&rdquo;, but Harry had lost his temper.
He pulled out his wand and shouted, &ldquo;<em>Expelliarmus!</em>&rdquo; and just as
Snape had disarmed Lockhart, so Malfoy found the diary shooting out
of his hand into the air.  Ron, grinning broadly, caught it.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Harry</strong> has his own wand and Draco&rsquo;s books.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Draco</strong> is going to have to buy new books.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><em>CoS</em> 200:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Harry reached his wand just in time. Lockhart had barely raised his,
when Harry bellowed, &ldquo;<em>Expelliarmus!</em>&rdquo;  Lockhart was blasted
backwards, falling over his trunk.  His wand flew high into the air;
Ron caught it, and flung it out of the open window.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dang, Lockhart already lost his wands.  Ron is actually throwing
<em>Snape&rsquo;s</em> wand out the window.  <strong>No changes</strong> here.</p>

<p><em>CoS</em> 203:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Get up,&rdquo; said Ron sharply, pointing his wand at Lockhart.</p>

<p>Lockhart got to his feet&mdash;then he dived at Ron, knocking him to the
ground.</p>

<p>Harry jumped forward, but too late. Lockhart was straightening up,
panting, Ron&rsquo;s wand in his hand and a gleaming smile back on his
face.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why doesn&rsquo;t Harry just <em>Expelliarmus</em> him again here? Possibly
because Harry&rsquo;s an idiot; but who knows, really.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lockhart</strong> has Ron&rsquo;s wand.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Ron</strong> has the troll&rsquo;s club.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><em>CoS</em> 227:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Harry, Ron, Hermione, Fred, George and Ginny got a compartment to
themselves. They made the most of the last few hours in which they
were allowed to do magic before the holidays. They played Exploding
Snap, set off the very last of Fred and George&rsquo;s Filibuster
Fireworks, and practised disarming each other by magic. Harry was
getting very good at it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, since we don&rsquo;t know <em>who</em> disarms <em>who</em> here (THANKS, J.K.),
let&rsquo;s just suppose that, since &ldquo;Harry was getting very good at it&rdquo;,
he disarmed everyone else.  That makes sense, right?</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Harry</strong> has Hermione&rsquo;s, Fred&rsquo;s, George&rsquo;s, Ginny&rsquo;s and his own
wands, and Draco&rsquo;s books.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let&rsquo;s review the scores:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Harry</strong> has Hermione&rsquo;s, Fred&rsquo;s, George&rsquo;s, Ginny&rsquo;s and his own
wands, and Draco&rsquo;s books.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Hermione</strong> has nothing.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Fred</strong> has nothing.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>George</strong> has nothing.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Ginny</strong> has nothing.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Lockhart</strong> has Ron&rsquo;s wand.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Ron</strong> has the troll&rsquo;s club.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Harry</strong> has his own wand and Draco&rsquo;s books.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Draco</strong> has a library card.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Snape</strong> has Lockhart&rsquo;s wand.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>James</strong> has Snape&rsquo;s and his own wands.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Dumbledore</strong> has Grindelwald&rsquo;s, Gregorovitch&rsquo;s and his own wands.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Grindelwald</strong> has nothing.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Gregorovitch</strong> has nothing.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_4"><em>Prisoner of Azkaban</em></h2>

<p><em>PoA</em> 14:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>I couldn&rsquo;t believe it when Dad won the</em> Daily Prophet <em>Draw.  Seven
hundred galleons!  Most of it&rsquo;s gone on this holiday, but they&rsquo;re
going to buy me a new wand for next year.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ron gets a new wand!  Since it probably &ldquo;chose&rdquo; him at Ollivander&rsquo;s, I
don&rsquo;t think it knows or cares that Lockhart disarmed him the previous
year.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Ron</strong> has his new wand and the troll&rsquo;s club.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Lockhart</strong> has Ron&rsquo;s old wand.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><em>PoA</em> 221:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It was Sirius Black.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Expelliarmus!</em>&rdquo; he croaked, pointing Ron&rsquo;s wand at them.</p>

<p>Harry&rsquo;s and Hermione&rsquo;s wands shot out of their hands, high in the
air, and Black caught them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Looks like Sirius took Ron&rsquo;s wand by force, then did some badass
double-disarmery.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Sirius</strong> has Ron&rsquo;s new wand along with Harry&rsquo;s, Hermione&rsquo;s,
Fred&rsquo;s, George&rsquo;s, Ginny&rsquo;s and his own wands.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Harry</strong> still has Draco&rsquo;s books, I guess.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Ron</strong> has the troll&rsquo;s club.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><em>PoA</em> 222:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But Black&rsquo;s free hand had found Harry&rsquo;s throat&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he hissed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve waited too long&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The fingers tightened, Harry choked, his glasses askew.</p>

<p>Then he saw Hermione&rsquo;s foot swing out of nowhere.  Black let go of
Harry with a grunt of pain.  Ron had thrown himself on Black&rsquo;s wand
hand and Harry heard a faint clatter&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ron proves himself not entirely useless!</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Ron</strong> has Harry&rsquo;s, Hermione&rsquo;s, Fred&rsquo;s, George&rsquo;s, Ginny&rsquo;s and
Sirius&rsquo; wands, along with his new wand and the troll&rsquo;s club.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Sirius</strong> has nothing.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><em>PoA</em> 224:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Expelliarmus!</em>&rdquo; Lupin shouted.</p>

<p>Harry&rsquo;s wand flew once more out of his hand; so did the two Hermione
was holding.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hermione was holding her and Ron&rsquo;s wands, but she didn&rsquo;t take them by
force from Ron; he still owns them (and Harry&rsquo;s wand), and Lupin
doesn&rsquo;t disarm <em>him</em>, so I don&rsquo;t think Lupin wins anything here. He
wins whatever wands are Hermione&rsquo;s and Harry&rsquo;s, which are none.</p>

<p><em>PoA</em> 236:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Harry made up his mind in a split second. Before Snape could take
even one step towards him, he had raised his wand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Expelliarmus!</em>&rdquo; he yelled&mdash;except that his wasn&rsquo;t the only voice
that shouted. There was a blast that made the door rattle on its
hinges; Snape was lifted off his feet and slammed into the wall,
then slid down it to the floor, a trickle of blood oozing from under
his hair. He had been knocked out</p>

<p>Harry looked around. Both Ron and Hermione had tried to disarm Snape
at exactly the same moment.  Snape&rsquo;s wand soared in a high arc and
landed on the bed next to Crookshanks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Shit.  <em>Exactly</em> the same moment?</p>

<p>The boring interpretation is that since no one person disarmed Snape,
nobody wins his wands.  But that&rsquo;s not our only option: look where the
wand lands!</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Crookshanks</strong> has Lockhart&rsquo;s wand.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Snape</strong> has nothing.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><em>PoA</em> 249:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Pettigrew had dived for Lupin&rsquo;s dropped wand. Ron, unsteady on his
bandaged leg, fell. There was a bang, a burst of light&mdash;and Ron lay
motionless on the ground.  Another bang&mdash;Crookshanks flew into the
air and back to the earth in a heap.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Expelliarmus!</em>&rdquo; Harry yelled, pointing his own wand at Pettigrew;
Lupin&rsquo;s wand flew high into the air and out of sight.</p>
</blockquote>

<li><p><strong>Harry</strong> has Pettigrew&rsquo;s wands and Draco&rsquo;s books.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Pettigrew</strong> has nothing.</p></li>

<p>Harry didn&rsquo;t want to miss the fun, but Uncle Vernon&rsquo;s second
ornament narrowly missed his left ear, and on balance he thought it
best to leave the situation to Mr Weasley.  He stepped into the
fire, looking over his shoulder as he said, &ldquo;The Burrow!&rdquo;; his last
fleeting glimpse of the living room was of Mr Weasley blasting a
third ornament out of Uncle Vernon&rsquo;s hand with his wand, Aunt
Petunia screaming and lying on top of Dudley, and Dudley&rsquo;s tongue
lolling around like a great slimy python.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This year, the Dursleys are going to have a pretty barren Christmas

<p>I was starting to fight my father&rsquo;s Imperius Curse.  There were
times when I was almost myself again. There were brief periods when
I seemed outside his control.  It happened, there, in the Top Box.
It was like waking from a deep sleep.  I found myself out in public,
in the middle of the match, and I saw a wand sticking out of a boy&rsquo;s
pocket in front of me.  I had not been allowed a wand since before
Azkaban.  I stole it.  Winky didn&rsquo;t know.  Winky is frightened of
heights.  She had her face hidden.&rdquo;</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Barty Crouch Jr</strong> has Pettigrew&rsquo;s wand.</p></li>

homework for him in the first year.</p></li>

<p>But it was no use&mdash;the spider was either so large, or so magical,
that the spells were doing no more than aggravating it&mdash;Harry had
one horrifying glimpse of eight shining black eyes, and razor-sharp
pincers, before it was upon him.</p>

<p>He was lifted into the air in its front legs; struggling madly, he
tried to kick it; his leg connected with the pincers, and next
moment he was in excruciating pain&mdash;he could hear Cedric yelling
&ldquo;<em>Stupefy!</em>&rdquo; too, but his spell had no more effect than
Harry&rsquo;s&mdash;Harry raised his wand as the spider opened its pincers
once more, and shouted,</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Expelliarmus!</em>&ldquo;</p>

<p>It worked&mdash;the Disarming spell made the spider drop him, but that
meant that Harry fell twelve feet onto his already injured leg,
which crumpled beneath him.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After disarming the spider, Harry no longer feels alienated from his
own body. He finds that he is more comfortable in his own skin and in
fact has better motor control too. (Now you might say, &ldquo;Alex, that&rsquo;s
stupid.&rdquo;  Yes.  <em>But how else could he survive the graveyard?</em>)</p>

<p>A jet of green light issued from Voldemort&rsquo;s wand just as a jet of
red light blasted from Harry&rsquo;s&mdash;they met in mid-air&mdash;and suddenly
Harry&rsquo;s wand was vibrating as though an electric charge was surging
through it; his hand had seized up around it; he couldn&rsquo;t have
released it if he&rsquo;d wanted to&mdash;and a narrow beam of light was now
connecting the two wands, neither red nor green, but bright, deep
gold&mdash;and Harry, following the beam with his astonished gaze, saw
that Voldemort&rsquo;s long white fingers, too, were gripping a wand that
was shaking and vibrating.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nobody gets disarmed here, we just get some <em>Priori Incantatem</em>

were several feet from Smith and taking it in turns to point their
wands at his back.</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>Ginny was teamed with Michael Corner; she was doing very well,
whereas Michael was either very bad or unwilling to jinx her.  Ernie
Macmillan was flourishing his wand unnecessarily, giving his partner
time to get in under his guard; the Creevey brothers were
enthusiastic but erratic and mainly responsible for all the books
leaping off the shelves around them; Luna Lovegood was similarly
patchy, occasionally sending Justin Finch-Fletchley&rsquo;s wand spinning
out of his hand, at other times merely causing his hair to stand on
end.</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, my dad is very supportive of any anti-Ministry action!&rdquo; said
Luna Lovegood proudly from just behind Harry; evidently she had been
eavesdropping on his conversation while Justin Finch-Fletchley
attempted to disentangle himself from the robes that had flown up
over his head.</p>

the door and watched it melt back into stone behind them.  &ldquo;Did you
see me disarm Hermione, Harry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Maybe Hermione&rsquo;s inexplicable attraction to Ron (the boy so solid he
cannot apparate half an inch across a room and who nobody likes) is
due to the fact that he&rsquo;s always got her wand.</p>

<p><em>OotP</em> 546:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take his wand,&rdquo; she barked at someone he could not see, and he felt
a hand grope inside the chest pocket of his robes and remove the
wand. &ldquo;Hers, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Harry heard a scuffle over by the door and knew that Hermione had
also just had her wand wrested from her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to know why you are in my office,&rdquo; said Umbridge, shaking
the fist clutching his hair so that he staggered.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here it&rsquo;s Malfoy disarming Harry and Millicent Bulstrode taking
Hermione&rsquo;s wand. (It&rsquo;s always Millicent who gets Hermione. I wonder
if Hermione smells like Millicent&rsquo;s cat because of the Polyjuice
episode and that makes Millicent inexplicably attracted to Hermione.
Huh.)</p>

<p>Anyway, Harry still doesn&rsquo;t own a wand. Too bad Draco didn&rsquo;t relieve
Harry of his homework planner, too; then Draco would get his books
back!</p>

<p>Hermione doesn&rsquo;t have shit either.  <strong>No changes!</strong></p>

<p><em>OotP</em> 546:</p>

<p>There was a commotion outside and several large Slytherins entered,

been gagged.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not only gagged but also, presumably, disarmed.  The tricky thing here
is figuring out who disarmed who.  Warrington is holding Ron and
Crabbe has Neville, so they probably also took their wands, but the
other Slytherins are unnamed.</p>

Hermione&rsquo;s wand, too. &ldquo;But Ginny was best, she got
Malfoy&mdash;Bat-Bogey Hex&mdash;it was superb, his whole face was covered
in the great flapping things.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ginny probably disarmed Malfoy, but otherwise we don&rsquo;t have much to
help us figure out who disarmed who, or how they got their wands back
from the Slytherins in the first place.</p>

<p>It would be nice to just say that each of our Heroes snatched their
wand from the person holding them&mdash;their physical injuries support
this, maybe&mdash;but even then, who got Millicent? The person who
disarmed Millicent was whoever cast the Disarming Charm
(<em>Expelliarmus</em>, obvs), so it likely wasn&rsquo;t Neville or Ginny. Given
Luna&rsquo;s relative ineptitude with the spell, there&rsquo;s a fair chance it
wasn&rsquo;t her. So let&rsquo;s say Ron disarmed Millicent.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Ginny</strong> has Michael&rsquo;s wand and some Slytherin&rsquo;s wand.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Ron</strong> has Harry&rsquo;s, Hermione&rsquo;s, Fred&rsquo;s, George&rsquo;s, Ginny&rsquo;s,

yelled; Voldemort screamed, &ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is for sure a disarming. But Voldy&rsquo;s using Lucius Malfoy&rsquo;s wand,

<p>Well, crap.  We&rsquo;ve got even less to go on here than in Umbridge&rsquo;s
office.  Greyback is the head of this band of Snatchers, so it might
be reasonable to assume that he&rsquo;s just giving orders and not actually
disarming anyone.</p>

<p>We learn a few pages later that Harry was disarmed by Scabior:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I know &lsquo;e&rsquo;s swollen, ma&rsquo;am, but it&rsquo;s &lsquo;im!&rdquo; piped up Scabior.  &ldquo;If
you look a bit closer, you&rsquo;ll see &lsquo;is scar.  And this &lsquo;ere, see the
girl?  The Mudblood who&rsquo;s been travelling around with &lsquo;im,
ma&rsquo;am.  There&rsquo;s no doubt it&rsquo;s &lsquo;im, and we&rsquo;ve got &lsquo;is wand as well!
&lsquo;Ere, ma&rsquo;am&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Harry saw Narcissa Malfoy scrutinising his swollen face.  Scabior
thrust the blackthorn wand at her.  She raised her eyebrows (<em>DH</em>
311).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I think all we can say is this:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scabior</strong> has Voldemort&rsquo;s wand (hahaha holy shit if he only knew).</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Snatcher 1</strong> has Mundungus&rsquo; wand.</p></li>

<p>There was a bang and a flash of red light: Harry knew that the
Snatcher had been Stunned. There was a roar of anger from his
fellows: Scabior drew his wand.  &ldquo;What d&rsquo;you think you&rsquo;re playing
at, woman?&rdquo;  &ldquo;<em>Stupefy</em>,&rdquo; she screamed, &ldquo;<em>stupefy!</em>&ldquo;</p>

<p>They were no match for her, even though there were four of them
against one of her: she was a witch, as Harry knew, with prodigious
skill and no conscience. They fell where they stood, all except
Greyback, who had been forced into a kneeling position, his arms
outstretched. Out of the corners of his eyes, Harry saw Bellatrix
bearing down upon the werewolf, the sword of Gryffindor gripped
tightly in her hand, her face waxen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where did you get this sword?&rdquo; she whispered to Greyback as she
pulled his wand out of his unresisting grip.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s really too bad that Greyback didn&rsquo;t disarm Harry et al., instead
of Scabior and the other idiot Snatchers. Too bad Bellatrix didn&rsquo;t
disarm instead of stun them. Then she would have <em>everything</em>. Oh

window.  The light hit both of their faces at the same time, so that
Voldemort&rsquo;s was suddenly a flaming blur.  Harry heard the high voice
shriek as he, too, yelled his best hope to the heavens, pointing
Draco&rsquo;s wand:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Avada Kedavra!</em>&ldquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Expelliarmus!</em>&ldquo;</p>

<p>The bang was like a cannon-blast and the golden flames that erupted
between them, at the dead centre of the circle they had been
treading, marked the point where the spells collided. Harry saw
Voldemort&rsquo;s green jet meet his own spell, saw the Elder Wand fly
high, dark against the sunrise, spinning across the enchanted ceiling
like the head of Nagini, spinning through the air towards the master
it would not kill, who had come to take full possession of it at
last. And Harry, with the unerring skill of the Seeker, caught the
wand in his free hand as Voldemort fell backwards, arms splayed, the
slit pupils of the scarlet eyes rolling upwards.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Looks like Harry is the master of the Elder Wand, after all. But this
whole thing still doesn&rsquo;t make any sense, and Harry really shouldn&rsquo;t
have thrown away the Elder Wand afterward since he doesn&rsquo;t own his
anymore.</p>

<p>Oh well.</p>
