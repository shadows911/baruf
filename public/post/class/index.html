<p>Matt Mazza, Editor-in-Chief of the radical zine
<a href="http://www.santabarbarasentinel.com/"><em>Santa Barbara Sentinel</em></a>, has
produced a trenchant essay on the class disparities in our city.
Taking the form of a first-person narrative, the piece brilliantly
parodies the tone-deafness of the wealthy and their ignorance of their
own privilege, as well as touching on the problematic tendency of our
media to serve as mouthpieces for local businesses.</p>

<p>An excerpt:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Family trips and incessant summer barbecues and parties are the norm
for our family in these wonderful warm months, and we always indulge
and generally have a blast.</p>

<p>But come Labor Day, man, I&rsquo;m straight burnt.  Worn out.  Beat down.
Bushed.  Bonked.  Bagged.  Zonked.  Tuckered.  Fried.  Whipped.  (I
love my thesaurus.)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m typically looking forward to re-focusing on the office (gasp!)
and putting some damned structure back into things.  And the
partying and vacationing and merrymaking is fun, very fun, but it&rsquo;s
also grueling.  (Punishing.  Debilitating.  Told you I love my
thesaurus.)  And this year was no different.</p>

<p>In fact this year was particularly egregious.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing, though.  Despite an absolutely crippling last
couple of weeks that left me emotionally, mentally, and physically
drained, I recently discovered a wonderful remedy that, when coupled
with the aforementioned structure and focus, already has me
reenergized and reinvigorated for the impending school year.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s the cure, you ask expectantly?  What doctor is most likely to
prescribe it?</p>

<p>Spoiler alert, folks: It&rsquo;s not something you <em>take</em>, and there ain&rsquo;t
no doctor who an give it to you.</p>

<p>My cure is somewhere you <em>go</em>.  Just for a night or two.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s simple, and it&rsquo;s right here in our collective backyard.</p>

<p>Three(ish) words: <strong>Bacara Resort &amp; Spa.</strong></p>
