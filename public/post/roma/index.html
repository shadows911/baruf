<a href="http://gawker.com/i-is-what-i-is-paula-deen-sobs-in-tense-today-interv-583684774" title="\&quot;I Is What I Is,\&quot; Paula Deen Sobs in Tense *Today* Interview">Paula Deen</a> has
had a chilling effect on other American racists.  How are they to
exercise their right to
<a href="https://twitter.com/squeenlatifah/status/350024436939898881" title="Tweet by @squeenlatifa on 26 June 2013">free speech</a> when there are such
consequences?  Your average racist could not be blamed for simply
packing it in.</p>

<p>But Julia Chaplin is not your average racist.  Her bigotry is
sophisticated and subtle, as demonstrated by
<a href="http://sbmag.com/2013/06/bohemian-rhapsody/" title="Bohemian Rhapsody">a recent feature in <em>Santa Barbara Magazine</em></a>.  The &ldquo;style&rdquo; she promotes involves some
egregious cultural appropriation, particularly against Indigenous
American peoples, and her books are boldly titled with the portmanteau
<a href="http://www.gypset.com/">&ldquo;gypset&rdquo;</a>, the combination of &ldquo;jet-set&rdquo; and a
<a href="http://www.rsdb.org/race/gypsy" title="The Racial Slur Database entry for \&quot;gypsy\&quot;">racial slur used against the Romani people</a>.  But none of this is
mentioned in the interview; Chaplin and &ldquo;her band of friends, artists,
musicians, and otherworldly vivants&rdquo; are described as &ldquo;a disheveled,
chic, colorfully elegant tribe that turns heads&rdquo;.</p>

<p>How did Julia Chaplin get away with this sort of behavior in our
politically-correct dystopia?  We sat down with her (<em>we did not</em>) and
asked her how to be racist after Paula Deen.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/dunndunndunn" title="Twitter for @dunndunndunn"><strong>CAT:</strong></a> First off, congratulations.</p>

<p><strong>JC:</strong> Thank you!  In a time when you can get in trouble for
<a href="http://thisweekinblackness.com/2013/07/01/white-feminists-netroots/" title="This Week in Blackness: White Feminists: Step Your Game Up">using stock photography instead of finding a single image of a feminist of color</a>, I feel
like I&rsquo;ve really beat the odds here.</p>

<p><strong>CAT:</strong> How do you think you got away with perpetuating racist
stereotypes against <em>multiple</em> groups with very little protest?  During my
exhaustive research I found only one
<a href="http://madamethursday.tumblr.com/post/26627290176/image-a-very-racist-appropriative-photo-of-a">Tumblr chain letter</a>
and a
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HYW6F8COMLH/ref=cm_cr_pr_perm?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=2759403963&amp;linkCode=&amp;nodeID=&amp;tag=">one-star review on Amazon of your book <em>Gypset Style</em></a>.</p>

<p><strong>JC:</strong> There are a few things I did that Paula Deen failed to do.
First, the groups I went after are even more marginalized than the
Black community is.  Racism directed at Indigenous and
<a href="http://gypsyappropriations.blogspot.com/2010/07/truth-about-gypsy-life.html" title="The Truth About \'Gypsy Life\'">Romani</a> peoples remains acceptable in a way
anti-Black racism isn&rsquo;t.  Remember that just recently
<a href="../docs/lucidity.html" title="When You\'re Lucid Dreaming You Can Do Anything But That Includes
Being Racist">a music festival was hosted in your own backyard</a> that engaged in blatant appropriation of various
Indigenous cultures, and another local magazine devoted
<a href="http://www.ventanamonthly.com/issue.php?IssueNum=79" title="Ventana Magazine: On the Gypsy Trail">half an issue</a> to playing on
<a href="https://staticnonsense.wordpress.com/2011/04/23/tw-the-bullshit-of-gypsy-magic-in-the-pagan-community/" title="[tw] the bullshit of \'gypsy magic\' in the pagan community">the racist trope of &ldquo;gypsy magic.&rdquo;</a>.</p>

<p><strong>CAT:</strong> Good points.  And there&rsquo;s probably something to be said for
committing some appropriation against different groups, rather than
going all-in on one.</p>

<p><strong>JC:</strong> Exactly, you want to diffuse the response.  There&rsquo;s no one group
that I&rsquo;ve single-mindedly victimized; that was the mistake of Lucidity
Festival.</p>

<p><strong>CAT:</strong> So the lessons are to choose multiple groups that remain
incredibly vulnerable and spread the damage around.</p>

<p><strong>JC:</strong> Correct!</p>

<p><strong>CAT:</strong> Well, this has been very enlightening.  Thank you so much for
your time.</p>

<p><strong>JC:</strong> It&rsquo;s been a pleasure.</p>
