<p>Readers of <em>SBBS</em> were introduced to Randi Rabin when we highlighted
her <a href="friends.html" title="The Case of
the Magical Magnetic Genitals">provocative deconstruction of gender</a> back in July.  Now, Noozhawk&rsquo;s
J. Edgar Hoover Distinguished Visiting Professor of Feelings is back
in the news with a short but insightful meditation on self-image and
bodily autonomy.  She recounts a question put to her recently by a
female recipient of breast implants,
<a href="http://www.noozhawk.com/article/randi_rabin_breasts_lead_way_husband_mail_order_bride_20131024" title="Randi Rabin: Woman's New Breasts Lead the Way; Wife Worried Husband
Is Seeking Mail-Order Bride">who finds that her female friends have become &ldquo;standoffish&rdquo;</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I went from a 34C to a DD, and they are beautiful.  I get lots of
attention&mdash;usually from men, and most of them are my girlfriends&rsquo;
husbands.  How can I keep my friendship with the women in my life
the way it used to be?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The superficial reply to these concerns would involve a discussion of
how women can uphold patriarchy by blaming other women for expressing
their sexuality and &ldquo;tempting&rdquo; men, and also how women are belittled
for pursuing breast augmentation while simultaneously being
<a href="http://www.mrdestructo.com/2013/05/lets-talk-about-angelina-jolies-breasts.html" title="Let's Talk About Angelina Jolie's Breasts">valued only <em>for</em> their breasts</a>.  The superficial
recommendations to &ldquo;Betsy Boob&rdquo; might include that she refuse to be
ashamed of her body and demand that her &ldquo;friends&rdquo; stop blaming her for
the behavior of their husbands.</p>

<p>But that would all be superficial.  It would, in short, be the
recommendation to <strong><em>LEAN IN</em></strong>.  And we know by now that
<a href="http://www.dissentmagazine.org/online_articles/feminisms-tipping-point-who-wins-from-leaning-in" title="Feminism's Tipping Point: Who Wins from Leaning in?">leaning in is not the answer to our problems</a>.  Professor
Rabin recognizes this, and accordingly recommends that Betsy Boob
instead <em>lean back</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Try having an open discussion with your girlfriends about what is
going on, and if by chance you are overly friendly with &ldquo;other
women&rsquo;s men,&rdquo; you may need to step back a bit&mdash;literally.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Randi Rabin understands that, aside from being a slogan for rich white
women that ignores the structural issues that create inequality, the
biggest problem with Sheryl Sandberg&rsquo;s &ldquo;Lean In&rdquo; movement was that it
encouraged assertiveness and self-confidence in women.  Rabin sagely
warns that &ldquo;if you are wearing low cut, extremely revealing outfits
and leading with your &lsquo;girls,&rsquo; rethink what kind of picture you want
to paint here,&rdquo; reminding us that
<a href="http://m.entrepreneur.com/article/225972" title="How
Today's Young Female Entrepreneurs Embrace Their Feminine Mystique">feminism is dead</a>
and that there are certain things that women <em>must not do</em>, such as
love themselves unconditionally.</p>
