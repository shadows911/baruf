<h2 id="toc_0">Submitting to <em>Baruffio</em></h2>

<p>Unfortunately, our budget is like nothing so much as the Weasley&rsquo;s vault
in <em>Chamber of Secrets</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The vaults were reached by means of small, goblin-driven carts that
sped along miniature train-tracks through the bank&rsquo;s underground
tunnels. Harry enjoyed the breakneck journey down to the Weasleys&rsquo;
vault, but felt dreadful, far worse than he had in Knockturn Alley,
when it was opened. There was a very small pile of silver Sickles
inside, and just one gold Galleon. Mrs Weasley felt right into the
corners before sweeping the whole lot into her bag.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That said, we do run ads and will pay contributors a percentage of
advertising revenue during the month when their piece is published.</p>
