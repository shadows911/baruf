&lt;h2 id=&#34;toc_0&#34;&gt;Submitting to &lt;em&gt;Baruffio&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, our budget is like nothing so much as the Weasley&amp;rsquo;s vault
in &lt;em&gt;Chamber of Secrets&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vaults were reached by means of small, goblin-driven carts that
sped along miniature train-tracks through the bank&amp;rsquo;s underground
tunnels. Harry enjoyed the breakneck journey down to the Weasleys&amp;rsquo;
vault, but felt dreadful, far worse than he had in Knockturn Alley,
when it was opened. There was a very small pile of silver Sickles
inside, and just one gold Galleon. Mrs Weasley felt right into the
corners before sweeping the whole lot into her bag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, we do run ads and will pay contributors a percentage of
advertising revenue during the month when their piece is published.&lt;/p&gt;
