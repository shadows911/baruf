<p><strong>Trigger Warning:</strong> Discussion of transphobia, racism, misogyny, rape, and other violence against women.</p>
<p>Last week, <a href="http://thoughtcatalog.com"><em>Thought Catalog</em></a> published an essay—ostensibly about a woman’s relationship with her boyfriend—that was full of anti-trans sentiments. A number of excellent replies were written, some also published on Thought Catalog, and we all hoped something had been learned. But today Thought Catalog pushed out an article by Jim Goad that was transphobic, racist, sexist, and pretty much exactly what you’d expect from one of the worst people on the internet.</p>
<p>The kicker is that this is Goad’s <em>sixth</em> piece for <em>Thought Catalog</em>. This is a problem.</p>
<h1 id="a-quick-review">A quick review</h1>
<p><em>Thought Catalog</em> is a dumping ground for first-person narratives about love, sex, and failed relationships. The anonymous author of <a href="http://thoughtcatalog.com/2013/i-think-my-boyfriend-wants-to-be-with-a-transsexual/">“I Think My Boyfriend Wants To Be With A Transsexual”</a> must have felt the urge to add to the pile, but, being a bad writer with a boring story (her boyfriend looked at ads for sex workers online and did not tell her), she used her boyfriend’s interest in transgender women to suggest that his was a uniquely horrible betrayal:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I wonder if you had leveled with me about your intrigue with these men who look like women, or women with the parts of men, I wouldn’t be so scared. Scared of not knowing you, of life as the fool who blindly trusts while you meet escorts, the partner who will never understand you or your fascination with what I cruelly call “things.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nico Lang—a producer at <em>Thought Catalog</em>—correctly <a href="http://thoughtcatalog.com/2013/keep-your-transphobic-bullsht-off-my-website/" title="Keep Your Transphobic Bullshit to Yourself">pointed out</a> that this is hardly different than blaming the failure of your marriage on “the gays”, and <a href="http://www.transadvocate.com/i-am-the-transsexual-your-boyfriend-wants-to-be-with-on-thought-catalogs-transphobia-problem.htm" title="I Am The Transsexual Your Boyfriend Wants to Be With: On Thought Catalog&#39;s Transphobia Problem">Kat Haché</a> and <a href="http://thoughtcatalog.com/2013/sorry-about-your-boyfriend-you-transphobic-jerk/" title="Sorry About Your Boyfriend, You Transphobic Jerk">Zinnia Jones</a> both wrote very good things about how <em>Thought Catalog</em> and our anonymous author, wittingly or not, contributed to the narratives that dehumanize trans people and have real, and dangerous, consequences.</p>
<p>But even though Lang recognized that the article should not have been published (his post was originally titled “Keep Your Transphobic Bullshit Off My Website”), <em>Thought Catalog</em> as an institution did not learn any lessons. Which brings us to Jim Goad’s piece today, <a href="http://thoughtcatalog.com/2013/spaying-the-queens-english/" title="Spaying the Queen&#39;s English">an extended tantrum about gender-neutral language</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The website to Sarah Lawrence College—which, if I’m not mistaken, was named after a chick—offers “Gender Neutral Language Guidelines” that provide a frightening glimpse into the latter-day leftist tendency to get everything backward. Their handy how-to manual accepts the term “gendered” as a verb, as if sexual dimorphism is a diaphanous social construct and one actually has to inject gender into the language, yet it frowns upon “transgendered” in favor of “transgender,” as if to imply that these self-mutilating freaks were born that way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Goad goes on to wonder if “we have to hire gender-indeterminate Negro scriveners to alter Lincoln’s Epersoncipation Proclamation”.</p>
<p>The really sad thing is that this is neither shocking, given who Jim Goad is, nor particularly offensive when compared to his earlier work. Goad is the <a href="http://takimag.com/about" title="About">editor of <em>Taki’s Magazine</em></a>, a website that publishes such <a href="http://takimag.com/article/im_not_a_racist_sexist_or_a_homophobe_you_nigger_slut_faggot/print" title="IÕm Not a Racist, Sexist, or a Homophobe, You Nigger Slut Faggot">appalling shit</a> that an article (by Goad) <a href="http://takimag.com/article/trayvonnosaurus_rex_jim_goad" title="Trayvonnosaurus Rex">comparing supporters of Trayvon Martin to the KKK</a> isn’t <a href="http://gawker.com/5899884/racist-john-derbyshire-writes-most-racist-article-possible-pegged-to-trayvon-martin-case" title="Racist John Derbyshire Writes Most Racist Article Possible, Pegged to Trayvon Martin Case">the worst thing they’ve published</a>.</p>
<p>(Jim Goad’s <em>Thought Catalog</em> piece was <a href="http://takimag.com/article/spaying_the_queens_english_jim_goad">originally posted at <em>Taki’s</em></a>.)</p>
<p>Goad also happens to be a raging misogynist who <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20110606154606/http://www.nypress.com/article-6057-jim-goad-is-a-bad-man.html" title="Jim Goad is a Bad Man">beat his wife and was jailed for assaulting another woman in his car and abandoning her outside Portland</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Goad has never expressed a scintilla of remorse. Asked if he’s sorry for beating Ryan, he tells me, “Absolutely not. I enjoyed it.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In case you’re still on the fence about Goad, here are the opening passages of his essay <a href="http://www.jimgoad.net/pdf/violence/lets.pdf" title="PDF">“Let’s Hear it for Violence Toward Women!”</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Women are only good for fucking and beating. When you get tired of fucking them, there’s only one thing left to do.</p>
<p>After you fuck them, they start talking. That’s when you beat them. They all talk too much, especially when you don’t want to hear it.</p>
<p>And what do they talk about? Violence toward women. But they fail to realize that their whining is what <em>provokes</em> most of the violence. They don’t understand what their eternal screeching does to men. Shut up! We don’t <em>need</em> to hit you. Just shut your mouths.</p>
<p>One simple rule, guys—the first time she gives you some lip, bust it open WIDE. She won’t talk shit again. Not if she’s smart, she won’t.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So what is <em>Thought Catalog</em> <em>thinking</em>?</p>
<h1 id="the-problem-is-that-thought-catalog-will-publish-just-about-anything">The problem is that <em>Thought Catalog</em> will publish just about anything</h1>
<p>Twitter user <a href="https://twitter.com/djbriandamage/status/358308916662243329" title="Tweet by @djbriandamage on 19 July 2013">@djbriandamage</a> called my attention to item 3 of <a href="http://thoughtcatalog.com/about/" title="About *Thought Catalog*"><em>Thought Catalog</em>’s “Ideals”</a>:</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>We believe <em>all thinking is relevant</em> and strive for a value-neutral editorial policy governed by openness. The more worldviews and rhetorical styles on the site, the better. We want to tell all sides of the story.</li>
</ol>
<p>And that’s just bullshit.</p>
<h1 id="a-responsible-website-does-not-publish-just-about-anything">A responsible website does not publish just about anything</h1>
<p>Claiming to have a “value-neutral” editorial policy, claiming to “tell all sides of the story”, or <a href="serious.html" title="A Serious Piece About Why *Noozhawk* Shouldn&#39;t Be Taken Seriously">smugly pointing out that opinion pieces contain opinions</a> is an attempt to evade responsibility for the content of what you publish. It doesn’t matter that <em>Thought Catalog</em> doesn’t endorse what Jim Goad has written. It wouldn’t matter even if <em>Thought Catalog</em> explicitly condemned what Jim Goad has written. The fact that they nontheless published it signals that <em>Thought Catalog</em> thinks that <em>Jim Goad’s bigotry is worth publishing</em>.</p>
<p>A hypothetical: would <em>Thought Catalog</em> repost other offerings from <em>Taki’s</em>, such as Gavin McInnes’ <a href="http://takimag.com/article/im_not_a_racist_sexist_or_a_homophobe_you_nigger_slut_faggot/print">“I’m Not a Racist, Sexist, or a Homophobe, You Nigger Slut Faggot”</a>? At this point I’m not actually sure, but I sure <em>hope</em> they wouldn’t. Why wouldn’t they? Because publishing that drivel implies that the view espoused—there’s no such thing as hate speech—is a <em>valid position</em> to hold. It doesn’t matter what <em>Thought Catalog</em>’s official position is; putting that on their site implies that reasonable people may think like that; it <em>normalizes</em> racism, sexism, and homophobia.</p>
<p>When <em>Thought Catalog</em> gives Jim Goad visibility, they endorse <em>him</em>, if not his opinions. This is wrong, and <em>Thought Catalog</em>’s ideals are wrong. Not all thinking is relevant, not all opinions are valid, and not everyone deserves a platform.</p>
<hr />
<p>And before someone brings it up, this is not a free speech issue. I am not saying that <em>Thought Catalog</em> shouldn’t be <em>allowed</em> to publish the shit they’ve been publishing. I’m just saying they shouldn’t. Because this stuff isn’t harmless, and if <em>Thought Catalog</em> is a responsible publication, they should care about the damage they’re doing.</p>
