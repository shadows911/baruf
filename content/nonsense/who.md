The blogosphere let out a collective *jolly good* earlier this month
upon learning that a white gentleman had been selected to represent
Doctor Who in *his* eponymous television show.  God continues to save
the Queen.

True devotees of the television event had understandably been rather
worked up in advance of the announcement, for there had been a number
of outrageous rumors and suggestions regarding the nature of the
future Doctor.
[Insufficiently British](http://thebottomline.as.ucsb.edu/2013/08/peter-capaldi-is-great-but-its-time-for-a-change/comment-page-1#comment-970526)
commentators had the gall to imagine the venerable man as something
quite unsuitable---namely, a man of color or, worse, a woman!

Fortunately, cooler (and paler) heads prevailed, and one "Peter
Capaldi" was selected to carry on the white man's burden of pretending
to be an alien on television.  But even with the question of
"diversity" settled forever, there are still some who insist on
[picking up pitchforks](http://thebottomline.as.ucsb.edu/2013/08/peter-capaldi-is-great-but-its-time-for-a-change

Fortunately,
[Coleman Gray comes out swinging](http://thebottomline.as.ucsb.edu/2013/08/should-the-doctor-be-doctored
"Should the Doctor be Doctored?") in today's *Bottom Line* against
this outrageous attempt to undermine one of the last opportunities for
white male employment:

Mr. Gray admits that "there are many strong female and racially
diverse characters" in the series, but points out that while female
and racially diverse actors do a good enough job in supporting roles,
they just aren't as good as white men.  The choice of a woman and/or
person of color to play Doctor Who would be a politicized choice,
biased by current social trends, in a way that the selection of a
white man is not.  Decades from now, we will look back and laugh at
the idea that a creature nearly a millennium old and bouncing about
the utter limits of both time and space could ever be accurately
portrayed by anyone but a white man from a small island in the
Atlantic.

Because trends come and go, but white men are forever.
