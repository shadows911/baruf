Marissa Perez of *The Bottom Line*---the only arm of our media empire
that actually does any work---today broke
[the story of a hate crime that occurred last month](http://thebottomline.as.ucsb.edu/2013/05/violent-altercation-breaks-out-in-iv-provoked-by-homophobic-remarks
"Violent Altercation Breaks Out in IV, Provoked By Homophobic
Remarks"):

This incident raises not only issues of campus climate but also the
dismissive attitude the police often take toward crimes against
minority groups.  Law enforcement is perceived by many to take the
side of those *perpetrating* hate crimes, instead of those victimized
by them.

In the wake of this story, the *Nexus* was not silent.  In today's
op-ed, Emile Nelson and R. Pengsta have a message for the
[GSRM](http://queerumich.com/post/25021141159/lgbt-lgbtq-queer-quiltbag-gsm-gsrm-whats
"Queer \@ UMich: LGBT? LGBTQ? Queer? QUILTBAG? GSM? GSRM?") community
at UCSB: 

[**Go away.**](http://dailynexus.com/2013-05-15/to-hump-or-not-to-hump-he-said-she-said-edition/ "To Hump or Not to Hump? He Said, She Said Edition")

Smoothly articulating the principles behind
[the mission statement of the *Nexus*](http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=101961#renewing
"Daily Nexus Mission Statement"), Nelson and Pengsta bravely defend
commonsense heterosexual values against the "compulsory homosexuality"
taught in liberal universities such as UCSB.  They also
unapologetically reaffirm the Biblical truth that men and women are
irredeemably different creatures, each incomprehensible to the other.

Nelson and Pengsta therefore present their polemic as a dialogue, with
Pengsta as the straight woman speaking to other straight women who
chase after men, and Nelson [reprising his role](batman.html "Batman
is Best at Everything, Including Fighting the Matriarchy") as the
misogynistic fuckwit who slut-shames his female peers.  Discussing the
Serious Problem of having sex on a first date, Nelson
[pontificates finely](http://dailynexus.com/2013-05-15/to-hump-or-not-to-hump-he-said-she-said-edition/
"To Hump or Not to Hump? He Said, She Said Edition"):

Nelson is of course perfectly correct that if a woman has had sex with
multiple (male!) partners she's thereby worthless, but that point has
been made more eloquently elsewhere.  His second itemized bit of
19th-century wisdom is rather more original.

It is a truth long-forgotten that men and women can only engage in
normal relations ("be friends", to use the jargon) when they are not
and have never been engaged in abnormal relations (have not "fucked
each others' brains out")---and
[perhaps not even then!](http://jezebel.com/5954769/for-the-love-of-god-will-we-ever-stop-asking-if-men-and-women-can-be-ever-be-just-friends
"For the Love of God, Will We Ever Stop Asking if Men and Women Can
Really Be \'Just Friends\'?")  Once the man has taken the woman as
his, she is no longer his equal and it is inappropriate and
emasculating for him to "talk to her" and "care about her opinion"
concerning Batman and similarly intellectual subjects.

So, by-definition-heterosexual **Ladies:** do you want to talk about
Batman with Emile Nelson?  Then for the love of God, don't have sex
with him.  But don't have sex with anyone else either, since that
would make you a ruined trollop, unworthy of his attention.

Maybe just don't talk to Emile Nelson.
