The *Daily Nexus* is not known for publishing cutting-edge research in
analytical philosophy, but on the 2nd of this month
[Mr. Jeffrey Robin authored a startling piece](http://dailynexus.com/2013-04-02/right-said-gay-or-not-marriage-is-already-in-the-dog-house/
"Gay or Not, Marriage Is Already in the Dog House") in which he
advanced a very novel claim of just this sort.  Here is the claim in
context; just prior to the paragraph I quote below, Mr. Robin suggests
that it is no use pondering whether *the homosexual* poses an
existential threat to the marriage institution, given that marriage
has been irredeemably fucked for some time.

> The shift in attitude and treatment of marriage has come both from

> be permitted.

I do not wish to downplay the importance of what Mr. Robin has to say
in the first three sentences of this passage---I entirely share his
belief that allowing the Negro to sit anywhere he likes was one of the
great stumbles in our nation's history---but I am here concerned with
the last sentence.  More precisely I am concerned with the following
conditional: "if nothing is true than everything must necessarily be
permitted."

How remarkable!  *If nothing is true than everything must necessarily
be permitted.*  The profundity of this statement cannot be
overstated.  In order that we may attempt to grasp it, a formalization
is in order:

<blockquote>
<p><math display="block" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mo>¬</mo><mo>∃</mo><mi>x</mi><mi>T</mi><mi>x</mi><mo>→</mo><mo>▫</mo><mo>∀</mo><mi>y</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>A</mi><mi>y</mi><mo>→</mo><mtext mathvariant="bold">PE</mtext><mi>y</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></math></p>
</blockquote>

Here *Tx* means *x is true*, *Ay* means *y is an action* and **PE** is
the permissibility operator.

Something of a conundrum confronts us if we attempt to move from left to
right along this conditional. The antecedent is only satisfied if
nothing (presumably no proposition) is true, but if the very conditional
proposition *if nothing is true than everything must necessarily be
permitted* is true, then the antecedent is not satisfied.

Can we learn anything by moving right-to-left?  It seems plausible
(even for a Communist such as myself!) that there are some things
which are not permissible: perhaps obstructing the overthrow of the
bourgeoisie, or being openly racist in a college newspaper in 2013.  In
any case, Mr. Robin certainly seems to believe that there are some
things that are impermissible: his invocation of this very conditional
is part of an attempt to discredit his political opponents by painting
them as moral relativists or, worse, as nihilists.  So if it's *not*
true that everything is permissible, then by *modus tollens* it is not
true that nothing is true.

Mr. Robin has established that at least *something* is true.  But
unfortunately for him, the undeniable truth that he has established in
his article seems to be this one: that Mr. Jeffrey Robin is an
imbecile.
