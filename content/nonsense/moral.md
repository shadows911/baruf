There is nothing like some bold, contrarian thinking to shake up the
stale Washington consensus.  Noted
[wanker](http://www.eschatonblog.com/2012/04/one-true-wanker-of-decade.html
"Thomas Friedman: The One True Wanker of the Decade") Thomas Friedman
is perhaps the finest practitioner of this art, the apogee of his
career being his bold and contrarian suggestion that
[Israel terrorize the Palestinian population](http://www.salon.com/2009/01/14/friedman_7/
"Tom Friedman offers a perfect definition of \"terrorism\"").  This
quite *new* idea took many by surprise, but has since been adopted by
the IDF to
[great effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Cast_Lead
"Wikipedia: Operation Cast Lead").  Matthew Yglesias is part of a
younger generation of wankers, but has risen rapidly in stature since
his inspired defense of
[collapsing buildings on poor people in exchange for cheap denim](http://www.mrdestructo.com/2013/04/destructo-salon-does-matthew-yglesias.html
"Destructo Salon: Does Matthew Yglesias Enjoy Murder?").

Though these wankers will eventually retire and die, there is no
shortage of young wankers willing and ready to replace them, as Mark
Strong proves today.  Faced with the classic tension between
"optimists" and "pessimists" and their disagreements over whether
things are getting better or worse, Strong makes the brilliant
proposal that we simply
[stop caring about right and wrong](http://dailynexus.com/2013-05-09/eternal-optimism-and-pessimism-both-impediments-to-human-progress/
"Eternal Optimism and Pessimism, Both Impediments to Human
Progress?"):

> Whereas a pessimist sees the glass half-empty and an optimist sees
> the glass half-full, a pragmatist simply observes the glass and its

> cut neatly out of the evaluation.  The situation is neither good nor
> bad; the situation just is.

This is a truly divine bit of wanking.  Strong pushes aside the
sentimental fools who cling to "principles" and presents his
pseudo-utilitarian neoliberalism as *the* detached, rational
worldview, unsullied by any sort of emotional attachment to the
millions oppressed by his beloved "bipartisan consensus".

Near the end of his pitch for *The World is Really Fucking Flat, Or:
I Want a Big House Like Tom Friedman*, Strong shows that his writing
is just as horrific as that of his spiritual father:

> While we're all entitled to our respective opinions, there is no
> productive value in the belief that humanity is headed for a cliff
> on a runaway train.  The same goes for plugging our ears with wax
> and tying ourselves to the mast.  Ship, train, plane or
> blimp---whatever comparative vessel you prefer, if we don't do
> something, it's going to crash.

Mark Strong's future looks bright.  The rest of us are fucked.
