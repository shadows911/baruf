Dr. Edwin Feliciano, a self-proclaimed "psychiatrist" at UCSB, today
appears to be attempting
[a séance in the pages of the *Nexus*](http://dailynexus.com/2013-05-22/anatomy-of-an-overdose/
"Anatomy of an Overdose"), and reports to us a story told by the dead.
Let us refer to the ghostly narrator as "Edwin":

> I am dead.

In the words of one commenter, ["Cool story, bro."](http://dailynexus.com/2013-05-22/anatomy-of-an-overdose/comment-page-1/#comment-172755)

But how did Edwin die?

> "What's one pill, man?" said my friend.  "People take six of those a

It shouldn't come as a surprise that Edwin isn't the brightest bulb,
but it's rather alarming that Dr Feliciano doesn't pause in his
spirit-channeling to point out that there are rather a lot of reasons
why *something would go wrong* when a person passes out at a party.
I can only assume that the good doctor knows something we don't (and I
guess that's to be expected, given that *he's* the one who can commune
with the dead).

> When the doctors discussed my "case" after I died, one doc said,
> "This is outrageous.  Too many kids die from this. How stupid can a
> person be?"  I was angry, but I hung around and listened to their
> "expert analysis."

"Expert" is rightly enclosed in quotation marks, because these doctors
probably don't even believe in ghosts.  But more interesting are the
quotes around "case".  What is Dead Edwin trying to tell us?  Was
there no real case?  Let us proceed with caution, dear reader.

The dead man's story continues with some bizarrely pedagogic
ruminations on his so-called case, and the claim that "what I learned
may help you stay alive."  That's a rather strange thing to tell a
doctor, but Edwin Feliciano apparently doesn't realize that a
passed-out person might be in trouble, so I suppose he could use the
advice.

As we reach the conclusion, though, a careful reader gets the
impression that this is not the monologue of a normal (if deceased)
19-year-old:

> The rest of the explanation got too technical for me.  By then, I
> didn't care to understand the "physiological" causes of my death.
> It boiled down to this: there is a difference between what you feel
> psychologically---relaxed, buzzed, happy---and what your body is
> experiencing internally.  While it may be easy to gauge your mood,
> alcohol and drugs are accumulating in your system at a rate faster
> than your body can metabolize them.  The fact is that the effects
> are delayed, so when you have one more shot, or an Adderall, or a
> Norco, you're creating a unique, often deadly cocktail in your
> body. That's what happened to me.  I got the message too late, which
> is, very simply, that mixing drugs will kill you, period.

> I should have stayed home watching the Sixers play the Knicks and
> having a few beers with my friends. I didn't, as you now know, but
> you have a choice.

This sounds less like the lament of a soul who is mourning the loss of
its body than a school psychiatrist who is insulting the intelligence
of his patients by making obviously false claims that lead students to
dismiss his advice---and therefore be *more* likely to make risky
decisions---instead of explaining accurately how common drugs interact
and urging young people to educate themselves about the effects of
what they put in their bodies.

So maybe ghosts don't exist after all.  They're just another thing Dr
Feliciano made up to scare us.
