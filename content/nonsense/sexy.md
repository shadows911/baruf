*Daily Nexus* writer Ben Moss, having failed to think of anything
interesting to write about in his Tuesday column, resigned himself to
authoring
[a thinkpiece on clickbait](http://dailynexus.com/2013-05-07/51217/ "<3-to-<3 in Ones and Zeroes"):

> I was mindlessly browsing the internet the other day, as one does,

> infatuated with "data scientists."

Yahoo! is refreshingly upfront about the disingenuous nature of their
article, admitting that to take it seriously
["you have to buy the logic that what makes a career 'sexy' is when demand for your skills outstrips supply, allowing you to command a sizable paycheck and options."](http://finance.yahoo.com/blogs/daily-ticker/sexiest-job-21st-century-122238562.html
"Yahoo! Finance: The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century") This is
bullshit, of course, and Ben Moss could have used this quote to segue
into a discussion of the sort of soulless careerism that leads people
into believing that the best job is the one that pays the most.  But
this being the *Nexus*, we instead get something bizarre and
completely inane.

Nothing turns Ben on more than turning *off* his roommate's alarm in
order to get a spot in ECON 3B; it's positively orgasmic.  And the
second-best part of his day is when he hears that SurveyMonkey cares
so much about his opinion that it reaches out to him *in person!*
(This is because nobody else does.)

Next, Ben addresses the question of *why* he gets so horned up
thinking about MySQL tables:

> My take on the paradigm shift is a little different. I think it's
> about the role data has played in our growing up and the way we use
> it so extensively now. After all, we've all sent off a meaningful
> email or an emotional text. We've all proudly fashioned our Facebook
> profiles to mean something about who we are. In one way or another,
> we've all had a heart-to-heart in the ones and zeroes of computer
> programming.

Ben is a living testament to the truth of Marshall McLuhan's famous
dictum that "the medium is the message."  He is unable to separate the
content of what he writes from the medium in which he composes it.
While researching this column, an anonymous source provided me with
one of Ben Moss' sexts, and you can see for yourself what living in
this digital environment has done to Ben's ideas of romance:

``` {.js}
for ( var i=0; i < 5; i++ ) {
  if ( i % 2 === 0 ) {
    alert("I love you");
  }
  else {
    alert("I love you not");
  }
}
```

(His deep immersion into digital media has also apparently erased the
distinction in his mind between "data" and "the ones and zeroes of
computer programming.")

In the conclusion of his essay, Ben finally recognizes his digital
addiction and vows to make a change:

> But I do think we need to make a practice of diplomacy, as it may
> not come as naturally in the digital age.  There's still something

As if anticipating this very piece, Ben Moss here declares his
intention to *stop making sense* in order to avoid the relentless
"digital criticism" that
[last week led the *Nexus* to surrender to the *Nonsense*](drama.html
"An Unlikely Friendship") and become a subsidiary of our media empire,
a misbehaving pet that we continue to scold.  We look forward to
publishing Moss' next column, which will consist of epic poetry
written only with consonants.

As of press time, Ben replied to his mother's text about his phone
bill with "Forever six times have I killed the wurm.  Life is death
and worse."
