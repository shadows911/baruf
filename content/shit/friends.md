Randi Rabin, J. Edgar Hoover Distinguished Visiting Professor of
Feelings at the Noozhawk College of Bullshit, today attempts to tackle
a new version of the age old Problem of Friendship.
[This iteration, due to noted scholar **Craig in Santa Barbara**, runs thus](http://www.noozhawk.com/article/randi_rabin_help_what_happened_to_my_15_year_old_angel
"Randi Rabin: Help! What Happened to my 15-Year-Old \'Angel\'?"):

> **Dear Feelings Doctor:** Please answer this "age old" question: Can
> men and women really be "just friends"?  Thanks very much.  I just
> need to know!

Craig in Santa Barbara has spent many years in the field, accosting
pairs of men and women in Chaucer's and asking them "but are you
really *just* friends?"  But his results have been entirely
inconclusive, and he appealed to our Distinguished Professor to
attempt to open up new avenues of research.  (His desperate search for
an answer to the question that has defined his career is evident: "I
just need to know!" he says.  But do you really *just* need to know,
Craig?)

Professor Rabin's analysis is rich and insightful.  She deserves a
good deal of praise for identifying "the bumpy stage of 'should we
sleep together to see if it's great or just be friends?'" that
inevitably precedes any "friendship attraction" between "women" and
"guys".  She also makes the keen observation that

> society has a difficult time figuring out this whole male/female
> friendship thing.  People seem to feel more comfortable when they
> know what column you go into.  It makes everyone feel safer to know
> that you go into this box or that box.  Well, guess what?  Fit into
> a box if you like, but actually, shhh---there really is no box.

This is a dense bit of argumentation.  For most readers, a visual aid
may be necessary to clarify what's going on:

+------------+------------+
|**Woman**   |**Man**     |
+------------+------------+
|interacts   |interacts   |
|amicably    |amicably    |
|with women  |with men    |
+------------+------------+

Rabin's thesis is that these are the societal criteria by which we
assign gender to individuals.  If they interact amicably with women,
they are a woman, and amicable interaction with men is a necessary and
sufficient condition for being a man.

These criteria are clearly problematic, but Rabin's criticism of them
is difficult to understand at first.  What are we to make of her claim
that "there really is no box"?  She cannot be saying merely that
gender is socially constructed, for that does not make it any less
real.  By saying there is no box, or are no boxes, she appears to be
denying the reality of gender in any sense at all.

Her final paragraph will only confuse the casual reader:

> Besides, being best friends with the opposite sex can be an
> illuminating, fulfilling experience.

Those not simply bewildered by the progression of her thoughts may
accuse her of lazily conflating sex and gender, but I believe that in
fact she's making a very subtle and clever point about our society's
view of gender relations.  By taking Craig from Santa Barbara's
question about the *gendered* categories of *woman* and *man* and
gradually moving to a discussion of the *sexual* categories of
*female* and *male*, our J. Edgar Hoover Distinguished Visiting
Professor of Feelings is demonstrating how this most idiotic of
questions---can men and women be friends?---can only emerge from a
simplistic view of men and women as necessarily both heterosexual and
cissexual.  Only by (1) ignoring the existence of gay, lesbian and
transgender individuals, (2) seeing sex and gender as synonymous, and
(3) probably being pretty emotionally immature could anyone take that
to be an open question worthy of serious discussion.

Rabin's scathing piece undeniably means the end of Craig from Santa
Barbara's research program.  When reached for comment, he was
surprisingly upbeat, however, saying that he now has time to study
where babies come from.
