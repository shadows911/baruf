Contemporary moral philosophy has hit a dead end, at least in the
academy.  Increasingly many students of ethics have become too willing
to defer to findings in neuroscience and to experimental methods in
general, often thereby confusing how we think about right and wrong
with how we *should* think about right and wrong.  Scanning my brain
with an fMRI machine to see how I in fact react to a moral dilemma
tells us nothing about how I *ought* to react.

Given this lamentable state of affairs, where is one to turn for new
insights about morality?

The *Santa Barbara View*, of course.

Today Sharon Byrne has shaken up the field with
[a novel argument for moral relativism](http://www.santabarbaraview.com/defining-some-points-on-the-political-spectrum536366/
"Defining Some Points on the Political Spectrum: Street vs Parlor
Liberal vs Libertarian"): the view that what is morally right or wrong
can vary depending on the time, place, or other aspect of the
situation.  Byrne---who, you will recall,
[does not have a PhD](home.html "Point-Counterpoint: Kill the
Homeless, or Just Treat Them Like Animals?")---circumvents the insular
realm of peer-reviewed journals and brings her findings direct to the
people.

She first contrasts *street liberals*, who are often activists and are
genuinely committed to eradicating oppression, with *parlor
liberals*, who support leftist causes as long as it doesn't require
them to examine their own privilege and complicity in systems of
inequality.  She illustrates the ideological gap between these two
groups with an example (unfortunately the editor of the *Santa
Barbara View* accidentally exchanged instances of "parlor" and
"street"; I have corrected the error):

> Hypothetical example: Normally tolerant [parlor] liberals get
> annoyed with their public spaces being taken over by homeless
> ... They take this stance with great angst.  Liberals are supposed
> to support the homeless, right?  ...  So how does this play against
> [street] liberals' agenda of funding homeless shelters in the
> [parlor] liberals' community, and expansion of civil rights for the
> homeless ... ?

While "street liberals" recognize that the homeless deserve the same
protections that the rest of us enjoy, the acknowledgment by "parlor
liberals" of the humanity of others depends on whether or not the
goings-on of the parlor is disrupted.

Byrne's second distinction is between liberals in general and
*libertarians*:

> Libertarians and liberals look alike on the surface.  They both
> support reducing penalties [for] illegal drug use, for example.

(Both also support universal healthcare, affirmative action, stronger
hate-crimes legislation, and a better social safety net.  They only
really disagree about whether [cars are basic](cars.html "The Freedom
to Choose \(A New or Used Automobile\)").)

Here Byrne sets forth the dilemma that motivates her thesis.  The
libertarian's worship of individualism would restrict regulation and
allow drug cartels to persist even if drugs were legalized.  That is
unacceptable.  But the liberal's solution, to regulate the drug trade
and prevent violent cartels from flourishing, would result in an equally
unacceptable loss of liberty, particularly to the cartel head.  What
is to be done?  What is the correct solution?

If you've read your
[Tom Friedman](http://www.eschatonblog.com/2012/04/one-true-wanker-of-decade.html
"THE ONE TRUE WANKER OF THE DECADE"), you know that the answer is
somewhere in the middle:

Sharon Byrne's relativist thesis can be expressed thus: *for every
pair of moral theories, there is a third theory that is better and is
a compromise between the two.*

By way of illustration, there is, according to Byrne, a compromise
between liberalism and libertarianism (liberaltarianism?) that is
therefore better than either.  But---and this is what makes the view
relativist---there is then a view that is a compromise between
*liberaltarianism* and liberalism, which is better than either.  There
is *also* a compromise between liberaltarianism and libertarianism.
And there are compromises between those compromises, and so on *ad
infinitum*.  No compromise is actually *true*, or even better than all
others, because there are compromises of that compromise, but each is
better than the views it is a compromise of.

This is all pretty abstract, but it's the most explicit formulation
yet of the centrist view that principles are weakness and there is
always a Third Way.  With Byrne's philosophical acuity and
[Mark Strong's youthful energy](http://baruffio.com/dn/moral.html "If
Thomas Friedman and Matthew Yglesias Had a Child, That Child Would Be
Mark Strong"), the future looks bright for bold pragmatists willing to
say what everyone has already said a thousand times before.
